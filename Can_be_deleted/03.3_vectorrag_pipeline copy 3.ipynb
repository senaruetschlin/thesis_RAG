In 2008, shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 10.5 million and in 2010, shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 17.5 million. In 2015, shareholders approved the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 13 million shares. Approximately 6 million of these shares were shares that were currently available under the 2005 plan and were incorporated into the 2015 Plan upon approval by\\nshareholders. In 2022, shareholders approved the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 12 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. The 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan replaced the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and none of the shares that remain available under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan are available for issuance under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\\nAwards under Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, strategic performance restricted stock/units, time-lapse restricted stock/units, special performance restricted stock/units, free cash flow (FCF) performance restricted stock/units and unrestricted stock. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goal (EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units), measured over a three-year period. A recipient of EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units earned a total award of either 0% or 100% of the initial grant. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics, net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a three-year period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of FCF performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow (defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities) compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. An annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. Performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. A recipient of FCF performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. In addition, we may issue special grants of restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October.\\nStock options are granted on a selective basis under the Long-Term Incentive Plans. The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a three-year period. In 2019, we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. We last issued stock options in 2019.\\nIn 2024, we issued time-lapse restricted stock units, unrestricted stock, TSR performance restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units. We last issued FCF performance restricted stock units in 2019, EPS performance restricted stock units in 2018, strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015.\\nIn connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition, we issued 1.721 million time-lapse restricted stock units (Replacement units) in exchange for certain Sovos Brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. The Replacement units are subject to the same terms and conditions of the original Sovos Brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. Certain Replacement units were subject to accelerated vesting. The Replacement units have a total fair value of $74 million based on the quoted price of our stock on the acquisition date. The portion of Replacement units attributed to pre-combination service was $42 million, which was accounted for as part of consideration transferred and was recorded in Additional Paid-in Capital in our Consolidated Statements of Equity. See Note 3 for additional information. The portion of the Replacement units attributable to post-combination service will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period. Also in connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition in 2024, our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goals for the EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were revised to equitably adjust for the impact of completed acquisitions and divestitures that were not contemplated at the time of approval of the original targets., ['humana inc .', 'notes to

In 2008, shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 10.5 million and in 2010, shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 17.5 million. In 2015, shareholders approved the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 13 million shares. Approximately 6 million of these shares were shares that were currently available under the 2005 plan and were incorporated into the 2015 Plan upon approval by\\nshareholders. In 2022, shareholders approved the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 12 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. The 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan replaced the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and none of the shares that remain available under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan are available for issuance under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\\nAwards under Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, strategic performance restricted stock/units, time-lapse restricted stock/units, special performance restricted stock/units, free cash flow (FCF) performance restricted stock/units and unrestricted stock. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goal (EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units), measured over a three-year period. A recipient of EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units earned a total award of either 0% or 100% of the initial grant. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics, net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a three-year period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of FCF performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow (defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities) compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. An annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. Performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. A recipient of FCF performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. In addition, we may issue special grants of restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October.\\nStock options are granted on a selective basis under the Long-Term Incentive Plans. The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a three-year period. In 2019, we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. We last issued stock options in 2019.\\nIn 2024, we issued time-lapse restricted stock units, unrestricted stock, TSR performance restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units. We last issued FCF performance restricted stock units in 2019, EPS performance restricted stock units in 2018, strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015.\\nIn connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition, we issued 1.721 million time-lapse restricted stock units (Replacement units) in exchange for certain Sovos Brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. The Replacement units are subject to the same terms and conditions of the original Sovos Brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. Certain Replacement units were subject to accelerated vesting. The Replacement units have a total fair value of $74 million based on the quoted price of our stock on the acquisition date. The portion of Replacement units attributed to pre-combination service was $42 million, which was accounted for as part of consideration transferred and was recorded in Additional Paid-in Capital in our Consolidated Statements of Equity. See Note 3 for additional information. The portion of the Replacement units attributable to post-combination service will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period. Also in connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition in 2024, our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goals for the EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were revised to equitably adjust for the impact of completed acquisitions and divestitures that were not contemplated at the time of approval of the original targets., ['humana inc .', 'notes to

Almost all of the Palisades nuclear plant output was sold under a 15-year PPA with Consumers Energy, which was executed as part of the acquisition of the plant in 2007 and expired in April 2022. Prices under the original PPA ranged from $43.50/MWh in 2007 to $61.50/MWh in 2022, and the average price under the PPA was $51/MWh. Entergy executed an additional PPA to cover the period from the expiration of the original PPA through final shutdown in May 2022 at a price of $24.14/MWh. Entergy issued monthly invoices to Consumers Energy for electric sales based on the actual output of electricity and related services provided during the previous month at the contract price.  The PPA was at below-market prices at the time of the acquisition and Entergy amortized a liability to revenue over the life of the agreement.  The amount amortized each period was based upon the present value, calculated at the date of acquisition, of each year‚Äôs difference between revenue under the agreement and revenue based on estimated market prices.

in our employees through talent recruitment retention training and development investing in external resources including procuring and deploying the correct tools to monitor evaluate and address threats investing employee resources to maintain effective processes and investing in strategic relationships to monitor evolving risks including third-party service provider vulnerabilities. while our third-party services providers have experienced cybersecurity incidents and we have experienced threats to our data and systems to date we are not aware that we have experienced a breach that had a material impact on our operations or business however cybersecurity risks that may materially impact the company are discussed in more detail in item 1a of part i risk factors under the heading cybersecurity and information technology risks which should be read in conjunction with the foregoing information. governance general our management is responsible for identifying assessing and managing our exposure to cybersecurity risk. management identifies and assesses risks through its cross functional erm committee that is responsible for, fis remains focused on making additional strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems from risks from cybersecurity threats. this includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware software staff and consulting services. these investments in the past have been and are reasonably likely to continue to be material to our results of operations. further notwithstanding our investments and other processes and efforts described above and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k we cannot guarantee that fis will not be the subject of a cyberattack that would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. see risk factors. the continued growth in the frequency complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks presents both a threat and an opportunity for fis. using expertise we have gained from our ongoing focus and investment we have developed and we offer fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry. we also use certain of these solutions to manage our own risks. we have not identified any previous cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us including our business strategy results of operations or financial condition. for a full discussion of risks from cybersecurity threats see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a., we have continued to expand investments in it security including additional end-user training using layered defenses identifying and protecting critical assets strengthening monitoring and alerting and engaging experts. at the management level our it security team regularly monitors alerts and meets to discuss threat levels trends and remediation. the team also prepares a monthly cyber scorecard which covers cyber operational controls along with internal and external threats. annual risk and cyber maturity assessments are conducted by independent third parties. further we conduct periodic external penetration tests and response testing to assess our processes and procedures against the evolving threat landscape. these tests and assessments are useful tools for maintaining a robust cybersecurity program that is designed to protect our investors customers employees vendors and intellectual property., we invest in enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities and strengthening our partnerships with appropriate business partners service partners and government and law enforcement agencies to understand the range of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. additionally we are a member of the financial services and information technology isacs and both a founding member and board member of the automotive isac. our membership with these industry cybersecurity groups assists in our efforts to protect the company against both enterprise and in-vehicle security risks., risk management and strategy nasdaq s brand and role as a critical infrastructure provider for global financial markets and operator of the nasdaq stock market make us an attractive target for cybersecurity risks including from international political opponents hacktivists and ransomware or other financially motivated criminals targeting the financial sector. our cybersecurity risks include financial and reputational damage along with collateral damage from loss of customer confidence in our exchange products or offerings as applicable potential regulatory enforcement actions or litigation either from governmental authorities or shareholders or the failure to comply with contractual breach notifications. to date no risks from cybersecurity threats including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business our business strategy our results of operations or financial condition. for further information see our role in the global marketplace positions us at greater risk for a cyberattack and expanded cybersecurity regulations and increased cybersecurity infrastructure and compliance costs may adversely impact our results of operations in item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10-k. our risk management and mitigation approach includes the adoption of security controls and adaptive ongoing threat analysis. our policies and our baseline security controls incorporate robust security infrastructure risk-based controls and multi- layered defense systems. we have 16 system and organization controls type 2 or soc 2 certifications with respect to our information security and infrastructure. our adaptive analysis monitors the threat landscape relevant to nasdaq our vendors and financial industry peers and threats arising from geopolitical events. as the external threat landscape evolves our information security controls are regularly evaluated updated and enhanced to help protect against emerging risks. additionally we conduct extensive cybersecurity assessments of our acquired entities both prior to acquisition and following completion of the transaction to understand potential threats and mitigate any potential security gaps as well as to ensure compliance with our security infrastructure and access management practices and policies. we periodically engage external advisors to perform an analysis of our information security procedures which include a review of program documentation and an overall maturity assessment of nasdaq s information security programs. these advisors provide recommendations to further enhance our procedures. the findings are then presented to the audit risk committee of the board of directors or the audit risk committee. in 2023 our management team and the board of directors conducted tabletop exercises and simulations in cybersecurity matters with assistance from internal and outside experts. we use certain cloud-based third-party vendors for the core trading systems of certain of our exchanges and certain of our governance products and solutions. prior to engaging such vendors we analyze each provider s soc2 certifications and perform due diligence and testing for information security and interoperability with our systems and annually review the soc2 certifications. our security assurance and threat assessment team within our information security organization collaborates with our external threat intelligence providers to proactively review nasdaq and our vendors with respect to emerging threats and associated risks. for our third-party service providers our risk assessment process evaluates the probability and potential impact of incidents related to operational errors technology disruptions information security breaches workforce issues internal and external fraud financial actions and legal and regulatory matters. this assessment process is part of our supplier risk management program which establishes processes for identifying assessing and periodically reviewing our exposure to risk through third party vendors. governance cybersecurity is an integral part of risk management at nasdaq. the board of directors appreciates the rapidly evolving nature of threats presented by cybersecurity incidents and is committed to the prevention timely detection and mitigation of the effect any such incidents may have on us. we use a cross-departmental approach to assess and manage cybersecurity risk with our information security legal risk and regulatory and internal audit functions presenting on key topics to the audit risk committee which provides oversight of our cybersecurity risk. additionally members from these organizations along with finance and accounting comprise a rapid response team that would mobilize in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident and would analyze and evaluate the incident while also advising the executive management team. our global risk management committee which includes our chair and ceo and other senior executives assists the board of directors in its cybersecurity risk oversight role. our audit risk committee receives quarterly or if needed more frequent reports on cybersecurity and information security matters from our chief information security officer or ciso and his team. the ciso has more than 25 years of experience in information technology and information security particularly in the financial services industry and our information security organization has more than 100 members with expertise in application security governance and compliance program and vulnerability management security engineering security operations security assurance and threat intelligence and security architecture. this regular reporting to the audit risk committee also includes a cybersecurity dashboard that contains information on cybersecurity governance processes and from time to time also includes the status of projects to strengthen internal cybersecurity ongoing prevention and mitigation efforts security features of the products and services we provide our customers or the results of security events during the period. the audit risk committee also reviews and discusses recent cyber incidents affecting the industry and the emerging threat landscape. cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and our goal is for all employees to be vigilant in helping to protect our organization and themselves at all times. we routinely perform simulations and tabletop exercises and

collateral at advance rates consistent with industry standards. the proceeds from repayment or if necessary the liquidation of collateral which is monitored daily are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn against these existing lines of credit. these lines of credit are primarily uncommitted as we reserve the right to not make any advances or may terminate these lines at any time. because many of our lending commitments expire without being funded in whole or in part the contractual amounts are not estimates of our actual future credit exposure or future liquidity requirements. the allowance for credit losses calculated under the cecl model provides for potential losses related to the unfunded lending commitments. see notes 2 and 8 for additional information regarding this allowance for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments. rj a enters into margin lending arrangements which allow clients to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. such loans are extended on a demand basis and are generally not committed facilities. margin loans are collateralized by the securities held in the client s account at rj a. collateral levels and established credit terms are monitored daily and we require clients to deposit additional collateral or reduce balances as necessary., the company s allowance for doubtful accounts which offsets accounts receivable and is included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and bad debts which reduce rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income have historically been very modest particularly in our residential business given the quality of our resident base and asset class. however due to the impact of the novel coronavirus covid-19 pandemic and extended eviction moratoriums enacted during the pandemic the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debts were elevated in 2021 2022 and 2023 though gradually declined throughout 2023. in accordance with the lease standard if we determine the lease payments are not probable of collection based on known troubled accounts rent deferral plans granted historical experience and other currently available evidence we fully reserve for any unpaid amounts deferred rent receivable variable lease payments and straight-line receivable balances and recognize rental income only if cash is received. if we later determine that these lease payments are probable of collection based on sustained clean payment history no deferral plans granted and other currently available evidence we will no longer fully reserve for the respective current receivable balances we will reinstate the straight-line balances for the respective leases and we will no longer recognize rental income only if cash is received. if the company s estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received then the timing and amount of the company s reported revenue could be impacted. see note 8 for additional details., dte energy has approximately 1.8 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2023 consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements. dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs. however virtually all dte energy s businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows. credit ratings credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities. dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets. dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets. however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various non-utility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energy-related products and services. certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade. the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial. also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the non-utility businesses could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity. a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets. the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants. while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews., selected measures of liquidity and capital resources certain relevant measures of our liquidity and

satisfied. our primary performance obligation the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers which is also when control is transferred. the transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. our policy for dsd including certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. similarly our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. as a result we record reserves based on estimates for product recall anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. our credit terms which are established in accordance with local and industry practices typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the united states and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally and may allow discounts for early payment. we estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility write-off history the aging of

product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. in addition dsd products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. for product delivered through other distribution networks we monitor customer inventory levels. as discussed in our customers in item 1. business we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. total marketplace spending includes sales incentives discounts advertising and other marketing activities. sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf such as payments for in-store displays payments to gain distribution of new products payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. a number of our sales incentives such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates are based on annual targets and accruals are established during the year as products are delivered for the expected payout which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. these accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. in addition certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred., accounts receivable the accounts receivable balance for the years ended december 31 2023 and 2022 was 182.7 million and 184.4 million respectively of which 32.3 million and 59.6 million related to the site development segment respectively. we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. in addition we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable. refer to note 15 in our

loss payments. the company has certain noncancelable commitments primarily under take-or-pay arrangements to purchase products or services from various suppliers mainly for consulting and other service agreements and standing orders to purchase reagents and other laboratory supplies. as of december 31 2023 the approximate total future purchase commitments are 793 million of which 214 million are expected to be incurred in 2024 352 million are expected to be incurred in 2025 through 2026 and the balance thereafter. billing and collection agreement, income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables that are uncollectible. we determine that a financing receivable is uncollectible when based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. we determine a financing receivable is past due when cash has not been received upon the due date specified in the contract. we evaluate the collectability of financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. if a financing receivable is determined to be uncollectible the customer is categorized as non-accrual status. when a customer is in non-accrual status at commencement sales-type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. if we have a note receivable with a customer that is in non-accrual status or a sales-type lease with a customer that changes to non-accrual status after commencement we recognize contractual interest income as payments are received to the extent there is sufficient collateral and payments exceed past due principal payments. residual values which are reviewed periodically represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. for operating leases revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. operating lease assets included in financing receivables and operating lease equipment net are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset. we periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. we record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. we evaluate for impairment assets under operating leases when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. reinsurance revenue our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary astro ltd. participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. the member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. reinsurance revenues were 163 129 and 126 during 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively. reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were 181 134 and 129 during 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively. revenues and costs are presented net in

stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair value of such shares at the date of grant . stock options and stock appreciation rights issued under the 2006 plan and the prior 1997 plan generally vest over four years and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant . for restricted stock awards issued under the 2006 plan and the prior 1997 plan stock certificates are issued at the time of grant and recipients have dividend and voting rights . in general these grants vest over three years . for deferred stock awards issued under the 2006 plan and the prior 1997 plan no stock is issued at the time of grant . generally these grants vest over two- three- or four-year periods . performance awards granted under the 2006 equity incentive plan and the prior 1997 plan are earned over a performance period based on achievement of goals generally over two- to three- year periods . payment for performance awards is made in shares of our common stock or in cash equal to the fair market value of our common stock based on certain financial ratios after the conclusion of each performance period . we record compensation expense equal to the estimated fair value of the options on the grant date on a straight-line basis over the options 2019 vesting period . we use a black-scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of the options

shares to satisfy awards of stock options stock appreciation rights unrestricted stock restricted stock units including performance restricted stock and performance units. in 2008 shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 long-term incentive plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 10.5 million and in 2010 shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 long-term incentive plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 17.5 million. in 2015 shareholders approved the 2015 long-term incentive plan which authorized the issuance of 13 million shares. approximately 6 million of these shares were shares that were currently available under the 2005 plan and were incorporated into the 2015 plan upon approval by shareholders. in 2022 shareholders approved the 2022 long-term incentive plan which authorized the issuance of 12 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options stock appreciation rights unrestricted stock restricted stock units including performance restricted stock and performance units. the 2022 long-term incentive plan replaced the 2015 long-term incentive plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 long-term incentive plan and none of the shares that remain available under the 2015 long-term incentive plan are available for issuance under the 2022 long-term incentive plan. awards under long-term incentive plans may be granted to employees and directors. pursuant to the long-term incentive plan we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return tsr performance restricted stock units eps performance restricted stock units strategic performance restricted stock units time-lapse restricted stock units special performance restricted stock units free cash flow fcf performance restricted stock units and unrestricted stock. under the program awards of tsr performance restricted stock units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period a recipient of tsr performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of eps performance restricted stock units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate goal eps cagr performance restricted stock units measured over a three-year period. a recipient of eps cagr performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of eps performance restricted stock units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. during the three-year vesting period a recipient of eps performance restricted stock units earned a total award of either 0 or 100 of the initial grant. awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics net sales and eps growth compared to strategic plan objectives during a three-year period. a recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of fcf performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. an annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. a recipient of fcf performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of time-lapse restricted stock units will vest ratably over the three-year period. in addition we may issue special grants of restricted stock units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. awards are generally granted annually in october. stock options are granted on a selective basis under the long-term incentive plans. the term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. the option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a three-year period. in 2019 we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. we last issued stock options in 2019. in 2024 we issued time-lapse restricted stock units unrestricted stock tsr performance restricted stock units and eps cagr performance restricted stock units. we last issued fcf performance restricted stock units in 2019 eps performance restricted stock units in 2018 strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015. in connection with the sovos brands acquisition we issued 1.721 million time-lapse restricted stock units replacement units in exchange for certain sovos brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. the replacement units are subject to the same terms and conditions of the original sovos brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. certain replacement units were subject to accelerated vesting. the replacement units have a total fair value of 74 million based on the quoted price of our stock on the acquisition date. the portion of replacement units attributed to pre-combination service was 42 million which was accounted for as part of consideration transferred and was recorded in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statements of equity. see note 3 for additional information. the portion of the replacement units attributable to post-combination service will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period. also in connection with the sovos brands acquisition in 2024 our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate goals for the eps cagr performance restricted stock units granted in 2024 2023 and 2022 were revised to equitably adjust for the impact of completed acquisitions and divestitures that were not contemplated at the time of approval of the original targets., humana inc . notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 continued in any spe transactions . the adoption of fin 46 or fin 46-r did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows . in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no . 123r share-based payment or statement 123r which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation . this requirement represents a significant change because fixed-based stock option awards a predominate form of stock compensation for us were not recognized as compensation expense under apb 25 . statement 123r requires the cost of the award as determined on the date of grant at fair value be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period . the grant-date fair value of the award will be estimated using option-pricing models . we are required to adopt statement 123r no later than july 1 2005 under one of three transition methods including a prospective retrospective and combination approach . we previously disclosed on page 67 the effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the black-scholes pricing model for 2004 2003 and 2002 . we currently are evaluating all of the provisions of statement 123r and the expected effect on us including among other items reviewing compensation strategies related to stock-based awards selecting an option pricing model and determining the transition method . in march 2004 the fasb issued eitf issue no . 03-1 or eitf 03-1 the meaning of other-than- temporary impairment and its application to certain investments . eitf 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on certain debt and equity investments when the fair value of the investment security is less than its carrying value . in september 2004 the fasb delayed the previously scheduled third quarter 2004 effective date until the issuance of additional implementation guidance expected in 2005 . upon issuance of a final standard we will evaluate the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations . 3 . acquisitions on february 16 2005 we acquired careplus health plans of florida or careplus as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company . careplus provides medicare advantage hmo plans and benefits to medicare eligible members in miami-dade broward and palm beach counties . this acquisition enhances our medicare market position in south florida . we paid approximately 450 million in cash including estimated transaction costs subject to a balance sheet settlement process with a nine month claims run-out period . we currently are in the process of allocating the purchase price to the net tangible and intangible assets . on april 1 2004 we acquired ochsner health plan or ochsner from the ochsner clinic foundation . ochsner is a louisiana health benefits company offering network-based managed care plans to employer-groups and medicare eligible members . this acquisition enabled us to enter a new market with significant market share which should facilitate new sales opportunities in this and surrounding markets including houston texas . we paid 157.1 million in cash including transaction costs . the fair value of the tangible assets liabilities as of the acquisition date are as follows . in thousands cash and cash equivalents 15270 investment

treasury stock method the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase

certain convertible units had an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of net income available to the company s common shareholders per share. accordingly the impact of such conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations. additionally there were 0.3 million stock options that were not dilutive as of december 31 2022. the company s unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents. the impact of the unvested restricted share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted shares participation rights in undistributed earnings., investments prior to our acquisition of keystone on october 12 2007 we held common shares of keystone which were classified as an available-for-sale investment security . accordingly the investment was included in other assets at its fair value with the unrealized gain excluded from earnings and included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes . upon our acquisition of keystone on october 12 2007 the unrealized gain was removed from accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and the original cost of the common shares was considered a component of the purchase price . fair value of financial instruments our debt is reflected on the balance sheet at cost . based on current market conditions our interest rate margins are below the rate available in the market which causes the fair value of our debt to fall below the carrying value . the fair value of our term loans see note 6 201clong-term obligations 201d is approximately 570 million at december 31 2009 as compared to the carrying value of 596 million . we estimated the fair value of our term loans by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume our obligations . the upfront cash payment excluding any issuance costs is the amount that a market participant would be able to lend at december 31 2009 to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under our term loans . the carrying amounts of our cash and equivalents net trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value . we apply the market approach to value our financial assets and liabilities which include the cash surrender value of life insurance deferred compensation liabilities and interest rate swaps . the market approach utilizes available market information to estimate fair value . required fair value disclosures are included in note 8 201cfair value measurements . 201d

exposure . we also self-insure a portion of our property and casualty risk which includes automobile liability general liability workers 2019 compensation and property under deductible insurance programs . the insurance premium costs are expensed over the contract periods . a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost which is calculated using analyses of historical data . we monitor new claims and claim development as well as trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves . self-insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets are net of claims deposits of 0.7 million and 0.8 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively . while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our insurance reserves and corresponding expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and assumptions . product warranties some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects . we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses . the changes

retail segment 2019s operating income was 4.7 billion 3.2 billion and 2.3 billion during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively . these year-over-year increases in retail operating income were primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during the respective years . gross margin gross margin for 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages . 2012 2011 2010 net sales 156508 108249 65225 cost of sales 87846 64431 39541 gross margin 68662 43818 25684 gross margin percentage 43.9 43.9 40.5 40.5 39.4 39.4 the gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9 43.9 compared to 40.5 40.5 in 2011 . this year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales . the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger u.s . dollar . the gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9 45.9 compared to 41.4 41.4 during the second half of 2012 . the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales . additionally gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers price reductions on certain existing products higher transition costs associated with product launches and continued strengthening of the u.s . dollar partially offset by lower commodity costs . the gross margin percentage in 2011 was 40.5 40.5 compared to 39.4 39.4 in 2010 . this year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs . the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2012 and the company anticipates gross margin of about 36 36 during the first quarter of 2013 . expected future declines in gross margin are largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases . future strengthening of the u.s . dollar could further negatively impact gross margin . the foregoing statements regarding the company 2019s expected gross margin percentage in future periods including the first quarter of 2013 are forward-looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including but not limited to those set forth above in part i item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading 201crisk factors 201d and those described in this paragraph . in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company 2019s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins . in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins . gross margins could also be affected by the company 2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products . due to the company 2019s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. ., aeronautics business segment 2019s results of operations discussion . the increase in our consolidated net adjustments for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily was due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our is gs and aeronautics business segments . aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research design development manufacture integration sustainment support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft including combat and air mobility aircraft unmanned air vehicles and related technologies . aeronautics 2019 major programs include the f-35 lightning ii joint strike fighter f-22 raptor f-16 fighting falcon c-130 hercules and the c-5m super galaxy . aeronautics 2019 operating results included the following in millions . 2012 2011 2010 net sales 14953 14362 13109 operating profit 1699 1630 1498 operating margins 11.4 11.4 11.3 11.3 11.4 11.4 backlog at year-end 30100 30500 27500 2012 compared to 2011 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2012 increased 591 million or 4 4 compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately 745 million from f-35 lrip contracts principally due to increased production volume about 285 million from f-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries 37 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to 22 in 2011 partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers and approximately 140 million from c-5 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries four c-5m aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to two in 2011 . partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately 365 million from decreased production volume and lower risk retirements on the f-22 program as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of 2012 approximately 110 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 and to a lesser extent lower volume and about 95 million from a decrease in volume on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to higher volume . net sales for c-130 programs were comparable to 2011 as a decline in sustainment activities largely was offset by increased aircraft deliveries . aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2012 increased 69 million or 4 4 compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately 105 million from c-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements about 50 million from f-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements approximately 50 million from f-35 lrip contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements and about 50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain f-16 contracts . partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about 90 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception- to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 approximately 50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the f-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 and approximately 45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume . operating profit for c-5 programs was comparable to 2011 . adjustments not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above were approximately 30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011 . 2011 compared to 2010 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2011 increased 1.3 billion or 10 10 compared to 2010 . the growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about 850 million for work performed on the f-35 lrip contracts as production increased higher volume of about 745 million for c-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries 33 c-130j aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010 and support activities about 425 million for f-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries 22 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010 and approximately 90 million for higher volume on c-5 programs two c-5m aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to one during 2010 . these increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately 675 million due to lower volume on the f-22 program and lower net sales of about 155 million for the f-35 development contract as development work decreased. ., aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2011 increased 132 million or 9 9 compared to 2010 . the increase primarily was attributable to approximately 115 million of higher operating profit on c-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks increased volume and risk retirements on f-16 programs of about 50 million and c-5 programs of approximately 20 million and about 70 million due to risk retirements on other aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011 . these increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately 75 million on the f-22 program and f-35 development contract primarily due to lower volume and about 55 million on other programs including f-35 lrip primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in 2011 compared to 2010 . adjustments not related to volume including net profit rate adjustments described above were approximately 90 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 . backlog backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to lower orders on f-35 contracts and c-130 programs partially offset by higher orders on f-16 programs . backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to higher orders on f-35 contracts which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the c-130 programs . trends we expect aeronautics will experience a mid single digit percentage range decline in net sales for 2013 as compared to 2012 . a decrease in net sales from a decline in f-16 and c-130j aircraft deliveries is expected to be partially offset by an increase in net sales volume on f-35 lrip contracts . operating profit is projected to decrease at a high single digit percentage range from 2012 levels due to the expected decline in net sales as well as changes in aircraft mix resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years . information systems global solutions our is gs business segment provides management services integrated information technology solutions and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil defense intelligence and other government customers . is gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments . is gs has been impacted by the continuing downturn in the federal information technology budgets and the impact of the continuing resolution that was effective on october 1 2012 the start of the u.s . government 2019s fiscal year . is gs 2019 operating results included the following in millions . 2012 2011 2010 net sales 8846 9381 9921 operating profit 808 874 814 operating margins 9.1 9.1 9.3 9.3 8.2 8.2 backlog at year-end 8700 9300 9700 2012 compared to 2011 is gs 2019 net sales for 2012 decreased 535 million or 6 6 compared to 2011 . the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately 485 million due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2011 primarily jtrs odin and u.k . census and about 255 million due to lower volume on numerous other programs primarily hanford warfighter information network-tactical win-t command control battle management and communications c2bmc and transportation worker identification credential twic . partially offsetting the decreases were higher net sales of approximately 140 million from qtc which was acquired early in the fourth quarter of 2011 and about 65 million from increased activity on numerous other programs primarily federal cyber security programs and persistent threat detection system ptds operational support . is gs 2019 operating profit for 2012 decreased 66 million or 8 8 compared to 2011 . the decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately 50 million due to the favorable impact of the odin contract completion in 2011 about 25 million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in 2012 and approximately 20 million due to lower volume on certain programs primarily c2bmc and win-t . partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately 15 million from the twic program and about 10 million due to increased activity on numerous other programs primarily federal cyber security programs and ptds operational support . operating profit for the jtrs program was comparable as a decrease in volume was offset by a decrease in reserves . adjustments not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above were approximately 20 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. ., table of contents research and development expense 201cr d 201d r d expense increased 34 34 or 449 million to 1.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 . this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded r d activities . also contributing to this increase in r d expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software development costs of 71 million related to mac os x snow leopard . although total r d expense increased 34 34 during 2010 it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52 52 year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010 . the company continues to believe that focused investments in r d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company 2019s core business strategy . as such the company expects to make further investments in r d to remain competitive . r d expense increased 20 20 or 224 million to 1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 . this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2009 to support expanded r d activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses . additionally 71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from r d expense during 2009 compared to 11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008 . although total r d expense increased 20 20 during 2009 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14 14 increase in revenue in 2009 . selling general and administrative expense 201csg a 201d sg a expense increased 1.4 billion or 33 33 to 5.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 . this increase was due primarily to the company 2019s continued expansion of its retail segment higher spending on marketing and advertising programs increased stock-based compensation expenses and variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company 2019s net sales . sg a expenses increased 388 million or 10 10 to 4.1 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 . this increase was due primarily to the company 2019s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on marketing and advertising . other income and expense other income and expense for the three years ended september 25 2010 are as follows in millions total other income and expense decreased 171 million or 52 52 to 155 million during 2010 compared to 326 million and 620 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively . the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year- over-year basis partially offset by the company 2019s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances . the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 0.75 0.75 1.43 1.43 and 3.44 3.44 during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively . additionally the company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts which further reduced the total other income and expense . during 2010 2009 and 2008 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense . provision for income taxes the company 2019s effective tax rates were 24 24 32 32 and 32 32 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively . the company 2019s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 35 due . 2010 2009 2008 interest income 311 407 653

2010 reflects management 2019s deci- sion to reduce risk given market volatility at the time . the firm 2019s average ib and other var diversification benefit was 59 million or 37 37 of the sum for 2010 compared with 82 million or 28 28 of the sum for 2009 . the firm experienced an increase in the diversification benefit in 2010 as positions changed and correla- tions decreased . in general over the course of the year var expo- sure can vary significantly as positions change market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change . var back-testing the firm conducts daily

organic revenue reflects benefits from higher realized prices and continued demand for companion animal diagnostics globally supported by increases in cag diagnostics recurring revenues. increases in our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging services recurring revenue also contributed to higher revenue supported by demand for subscription-based software. higher revenue in our water business was primarily due to the benefit of price increases and higher testing volumes in certain international regions as well as the benefit of an acquisition in the third quarter of 2022. the decline in our lpd business was primarily due to lower herd health screening volume partially offset by higher realized prices and volume growth in north america europe and south america. the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to lower sales of opti covid-19 pcr testing products and services following the discontinuation of active marketing of such products and services in the first quarter of 2023.the impact of currency movements decreased total revenue growth by 0.2 while the impact of acquisitions increased total revenue growth by 0.1 . the following table presents our total company

monitoring solutions and consumables and services product lines driven by an increase in price and operational improvements and pdx segment revenues were 2 306 million growing 18 or 348 million with growth across all regions due to an increase in price and improved demand. the regional revenues were as follows, greater china segment net sales from greater china decreased by 40.8 million or 2 for the year ended december 31 2023 when compared to the prior year. this decrease was the result of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 87.1 million or 4 . constant

self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. as the largest owner of self-storage facilities we believe that we own approximately 9 of the self-storage square footage in the u.s. and that collectively the four largest self-storage owners in the u.s. own approximately 20 with the remaining 80 owned by regional and local operators. we believe our public storage brand awareness as well as the innovative improvements we have made to the customer experience described below provide us with a competitive advantage in acquiring and retaining customers relative to other self-storage operators. the high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators who use marketing channels including internet advertising signage and banners and offer services similar to ours. as a result competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels rental rates rental income and operating expenses of our facilities. however we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business result in our being able to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale., 201cati 201d and spectrasite communications llc 201cspectrasite 201d . we conduct our

of return of 6.9 percent . 2022 2015 net mark-to-market loss of 179 million - primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets u.s . pension plans had an actual rate of return of 2.0 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 7.4 percent which was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2015 compared to 2014 . the net mark-to-market losses were in the following results of operations line items . millions of dollars years ended december 31 2017 years ended december 31 2016 years ended december 31 2015

accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to the presentation of net periodic pension and opeb costs . this guidance requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost . service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period . the other components of net benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations . as a result components of pension and opeb costs other than service costs will be reclassified from operating costs to other income expense . this change will be applied retrospectively to prior years . in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our u.s . pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants . as of december 31 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 290 million . in the fourth quarter of 2016 the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the soa for our u.s . pension and opeb plans . as of december 31 2016 this resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 200 million . in the first quarter of 2017 we announced the closure of our gosselies belgium facility . this announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a curtailment and the recognition of termination benefits . in march 2017 we recognized a net loss of 20 million for the curtailment and termination benefits . in addition we announced the decision to phase out production at our aurora illinois facility which resulted in termination benefits of 9 million for certain hourly employees that participate in our u.s . hourly defined benefit pension plan . beginning in 2016 we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows . service and interest costs in 2017 and 2016 were lower by 140 million and 180 million respectively under the new method than they would have been under the previous method . this change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and opeb obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss gain reported for the respective year . we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses to decrease approximately 80 million in 2018 . this decrease is primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets as a result of a higher asset base in 2018 . in general our strategy for both the u.s . and the non-u.s . pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities while reducing risk in our portfolio . for our u.s . pension plans our year-end 2017 asset allocation was 34 a0percent equities 62 a0percent fixed income and 4 percent other . our current u.s . pension target asset allocation is 30 percent equities and 70 percent fixed income . the target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives . the u.s . plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis . the year-end 2017 asset allocation for our non-u.s . pension plans was 40 a0percent equities 53 a0percent fixed income 4 a0percent real estate and 3 percent other . the 2017 weighted-average target allocations for our non-u.s . pension plans was 38 a0percent equities 54 a0percent fixed income 5 a0percent real estate and 3 a0percent other . the target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements demographics of the plan participants and funded status . the frequency of rebalancing for the non-u.s . plans varies depending on the plan . contributions to our pension and opeb plans were 1.6 billion and 329 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively . the 2017 contributions include a 1.0 billion discretionary contribution made to our u.s . pension plans in december 2017 . we expect to make approximately 365 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2018 . we believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and opeb plans . 48 2017 form 10-k .,

to be received under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 which total no more than 0.3 in any individual year . savings plans we sponsor defined contribution plans the 201csavings plans 201d that cover substantially all domestic employees . the savings plans permit participants to make contributions on a pre-tax and or after-tax basis and allow participants to choose among various investment alternatives . we match a portion of participant contributions based upon their years of service . amounts expensed for the savings plans for 2018 2017 and 2016 were 52.6 47.2 and 47.0 respectively . expenses include a discretionary company contribution of 6.7 3.6 and 6.1 offset by participant forfeitures of 5.8 4.6 and 4.4 in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively . in addition we maintain defined contribution plans in various foreign countries and contributed 51.3 47.4 and 44.5 to these plans in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively . deferred compensation and benefit arrangements we have deferred compensation and benefit arrangements which i permit certain of our key officers and employees to defer a portion of their salary or incentive compensation or ii require us to contribute an amount to the participant 2019s account . these arrangements may provide participants with the amounts deferred plus interest upon attaining certain conditions such as completing a certain number of years of service attaining a certain age or upon retirement or termination . as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the deferred compensation and deferred benefit liability balance was 196.2 and 213.2 respectively . amounts expensed for deferred compensation and benefit arrangements in 2018 2017 and 2016 were 10.0 18.5 and 18.5 respectively . we have purchased life insurance policies on participants 2019 lives to assist in the funding of the related deferred compensation and deferred benefit liabilities . as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the cash surrender value of these policies was 177.3 and 177.4 respectively . long-term disability plan we have a long-term disability plan which provides income replacement benefits to eligible participants who are unable to perform their job duties or any job related to his or her education training or experience . as all income replacement benefits are fully insured no related obligation is required as of december 31 2018 and 2017 . in addition to income replacement benefits plan participants may remain covered for certain health and life insurance benefits up to normal retirement age and accordingly we have recorded an obligation of 5.9 and 8.4 as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively. ., we have material cash requirements for known contractual obligations and commitments in the form of finance leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities that are disclosed in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and discussed below. we expect to fund these obligations and other discretionary payments including expected returns to shareowners primarily through cash from operations. we anticipate making discretionary contributions to our company-sponsored u.s. defined benefit pension and postretirement medical benefit plans of approximately 1.3 billion in 2024 which are included within expected employer contributions to plan trusts shown in note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements. there are currently no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified u.s. pension plans in 2024. the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including plan asset returns discount rates other actuarial assumptions changes to pension plan funding regulations and the discretionary contributions that we make. actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2024 cannot be reasonably estimated. we expect contributions to the ups 401 k savings plan to be approximately 670 million in 2024. as discussed in note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any surcharges or minimum contributions outside of our agreed-upon contractual rates with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate. contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process. we have outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that are discussed in note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements. additionally we have 1.5 billion of fixed- and floating-rate senior notes that mature in 2024. we intend to repay or refinance these amounts when due. estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt total approximately 14.7 billion. this amount was calculated using the contractual interest payments due on our fixed- and variable-rate debt based on interest rates as of december 31 2023. for debt denominated in a foreign currency the u.s. dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to project future interest payments. annual principal payments on our long-term debt and purchase commitments for certain capital expenditures are also set out in note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements. included within these purchase commitments are firm commitments to purchase 21 new boeing 767-300 aircraft to be delivered between 2024 and 2026 and two used boeing 747-8f aircraft to be delivered in 2024. additionally we anticipate purchasing approximately 3 000 alternative fuel vehicles in 2024. in addition to purchase commitments we have other contractual agreements including equipment rentals software licensing and commodity contracts. our finance lease obligations including purchase options that are reasonably certain to be exercised relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate. these obligations together with our obligations under operating leases are set out in note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements. under provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act we elected to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries over eight years. the remaining balance will be paid between 2024 and 2026. additionally we have uncertain tax positions that are further discussed in note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements. as discussed in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2023 we had a restricted cash balance related to certain tax and regulatory matters in italy. we anticipate this balance will increase by approximately 61 million in 2024., 2017 form 10-k 115 and 1088 million respectively were primarily comprised of loans to dealers and the spc 2019s liabilities of 1106 million and 1087 million respectively were primarily comprised of commercial paper . the assets of the spc are not available to pay cat financial 2019s creditors . cat financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the spc experiences losses . no loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement . cat financial is party to agreements in the normal course of business with selected customers and caterpillar dealers in which they commit to provide a set dollar amount of financing on a pre- approved basis . they also provide lines of credit to certain customers and caterpillar dealers of which a portion remains unused as of the end of the period . commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses . it has been cat financial 2019s experience that not all commitments and lines of credit will be used . management applies the same credit policies when making commitments and granting lines of credit as it does for any other financing . cat financial does not require collateral for these commitments lines but if credit is extended collateral may be required upon funding . the amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for dealers as of december 31 2017 and 2016 was 10993 million and 12775 million respectively . the amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for customers as of december 31 2017 and 2016 was 3092 million and 3340 million respectively . our product warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory . generally historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model engine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america . specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. . millions of dollars 2017 2016 warranty liability january 1 1258 1354 reduction in

state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions . in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines . we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards . we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws . when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings . costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience . where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum . where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs . in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others . we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis . the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expenses . we believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required . on january 7 2015 the company received a grand jury subpoena from the u.s . district court for the central district of illinois . the subpoena requests documents and information from the company relating to among other things financial information concerning u.s . and non-u.s . caterpillar subsidiaries including undistributed profits of non-u.s . subsidiaries and the movement of cash among u.s . and non-u.s . subsidiaries . the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to among other things the purchase and resale of replacement parts by caterpillar inc . and non-u.s . caterpillar subsidiaries dividend distributions of certain non-u.s . caterpillar subsidiaries and caterpillar sarl and related structures . on march 2-3 2017 agents with the department of commerce the federal deposit insurance corporation and the internal revenue service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the company in the peoria illinois area including its former corporate headquarters . the warrants identify and agents seized documents and information related to among other things the export of products from the united states the movement of products between the united states and switzerland the relationship between caterpillar inc . and caterpillar sarl and sales outside the united states . it is the company 2019s understanding that the warrants which concern both tax and export activities are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation . the company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation . the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company 2019s consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity . on march 20 2014 brazil 2019s administrative council for economic defense cade published a technical opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants including two subsidiaries of caterpillar inc. mge - equipamentos e servi e7os ferrovi e1rios ltda . mge and caterpillar brasil ltda . the publication of the technical opinion opened cade 2019s official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance

equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity . equity securities equity securities are valued at the closing market price reported on a u.s . or international exchange where the security is actively traded and are therefore classified as level 1 assets . equity mutual and pooled funds shares of mutual funds are valued at the net asset value nav of the fund and are classified as level 1 assets . units of pooled funds are valued at the per unit nav determined by the fund manager based on the value of the underlying traded holdings and are classified as level 2 assets . corporate and government bonds corporate and government bonds are classified as level 2 assets as they are either valued at quoted market prices from observable pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields and credit ratings . other pooled funds other pooled funds classified as level 2 assets are valued at the nav of the shares held at year end which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments . securities and interests classified as level 3 are carried at the estimated fair value . the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment values which includes estimated bids from brokers or other third-party vendor sources that utilize expected cash flow streams and other uncorroborated data including counterparty credit quality default risk discount rates and the overall capital market liquidity . insurance contracts insurance contracts are classified as level 3 assets as they are carried at contract value which approximates the estimated fair value . the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of the insurance company and discount rates that require inputs with limited observability . contributions and projected benefit payments pension contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans for fiscal year 2018 were 68.3 . contributions for funded plans resulted primarily from contractual and regulatory requirements . benefit payments to unfunded plans were due primarily to the timing of retirements . we anticipate contributing 45 to 65 to the defined benefit pension plans in fiscal year 2019 . these contributions are anticipated to be driven primarily by contractual and regulatory requirements for funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon timing of retirements . projected benefit payments which reflect expected future service are as follows . u.s . international 2019 165.5 52.8 2020 152.4 53.9 2021 157.0 55.6 2022 163.7 56.0 2023 167.9 60.6 2024-2028 900.2 336.8 these estimated benefit payments are based on

retirement healthcare plan as part of our acquisition of allied . this plan provides continued medical coverage for certain former employees following their retirement including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements . eligibility for this plan is limited to certain of those employees who had ten or more years of service and were age 55 or older as of december 31 1998 and certain employees in california who were hired on or before december 31 2005 and who retire on or after age 55 with at least thirty years of service . liabilities acquired for this plan were 1.2 million and 1.3 million respectively at the acquisition date and at december 31 2008 . multi-employer pension plans we contribute to 25 multi-employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements covering union- represented employees . we acquired responsibility for contributions for a portion of these plans as part of our acquisition of allied . approximately 22 22 of our total current employees are participants in such multi- employer plans . these plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers . we do not administer these multi-employer plans . in general these plans are managed by a board of trustees with the unions appointing certain trustees and other contributing employers of the plan appointing certain members . we generally are not represented on the board of trustees . we do not have current plan financial information from the plans 2019 administrators but based on the information available to us it is possible that some of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute may be underfunded . the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding . until the plan trustees develop the funding improvement plans or rehabilitation plans as required by the pension protection act we are unable to determine the amount of assessments we may be subject to if any . accordingly we cannot determine at this time the impact that the pension protection act may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows . furthermore under current law regarding multi-employer benefit plans a plan 2019s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any under-funded multi-employer pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi- employer plan 2019s unfunded vested liabilities . it is possible that there may be a mass withdrawal of employers contributing to these plans or plans may terminate in the near future . we could have adjustments to our estimates for these matters in the near term that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows . our pension expense for multi-employer plans was 21.8 million 18.9 million and 17.3 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively . republic services inc . and subsidiaries notes to

following contractual obligations outstanding fixed-rate debt maturing at various times with an aggregate principal amount of 5.7 billion of which 750 million is due in 2024. depending on the conditions in the credit markets we may refinance this debt or we may use cash from operations and temporarily access our credit facility or term loan facility to repay this debt. future interest payments on our debt total 716.7 million of which 155.4 million is payable in 2024. the liability for our operating and finance lease payments is 1 492.5 million of which 309.3 million is due in 2024. the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is 224.3 million and the liability for our postemployment arrangements is 142.2 million. in 2023 we contributed 8.8 million to our defined benefit plans and paid 10.9 million for our postemployment arrangements. we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2024. the liability for contingent purchase price payments earn-outs is 229.5 million of which 62.4 million is payable in 2024. the remaining balance for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings imposed by the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 is 68.9 million of which 27.7 million is payable in 2024. based on past performance and current expectations we believe that net cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our non-discretionary cash requirements for the next twelve months. in addition and over the longer term our credit facility and term loan facility are available to fund our working capital and contractual obligations., the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for our revenue recognition policies. pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increase. the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. the guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. we decreased our discount rate to 5.06 at the end of fiscal 2024 from 5.94 at the end of fiscal 2023 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2024 year-end measurement date. the company s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2025 by approximately 0.2 billion and would increase the projected benefit obligation at september 28 2024 by approximately 2.4 billion. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately 0.2 billion and 2.1 billion respectively. to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. our expected return on plan assets is 7.25 . a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. a one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2025 annual expense by approximately 168 million. goodwill other intangible assets long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require on an interim basis. the company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. to test goodwill for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. if it is a quantitative assessment is required. alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. the impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units determining whether reporting units should be aggregated the assignment of assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. in fiscal 2024 we determined that our entertainment businesses including dtc services linear networks and content sales licensing should be aggregated into a single reporting unit due to their interdependencies including shared operating costs such as content marketing and technology the similarity of products and services delivered customers served and distribution channels used and projected long term financial performance e.g. operating margins . for our annual impairment test we bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment. to determine the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flows corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators as well as industry growth projections. discount rates are determined based on the inherent risks of the underlying operations. significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model used to determine fair value relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses operating margins terminal growth rates and discount rates. we believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our businesses. changes to these assumptions and shifts in market trends or macroeconomic events could impact test results in the future. as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 the company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of 0.7 billion and 0.6 billion respectively related to our entertainment linear networks reporting unit prior to aggregating all of our entertainment reporting units into a single reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. the carrying amount of the aggregated entertainment reporting unit goodwill after these impairments is approximately 51 billion. after the impairments the fair value of the entertainment reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount by less than 10 . an approximate 40 basis point increase in the discount rate or an approximate 6 reduction in projected annual cash flows used to determine the fair value of the entertainment reporting unit would effectively eliminate the excess fair value over carrying amount. to test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. if it is a quantitative assessment is required. alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows. the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate. the company tests long-lived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. once a triggering event has occurred the impairment test employed is based on whether the company s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. an asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. for assets held for sale to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset s fair value less costs to sell an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions including whether a triggering event has occurred the identification of asset groups estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the company recorded 1.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to the star india transaction in fiscal 2024 to reflect star india at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. the company has investments in equity securities. for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. if these forecasts are not met impairment charges may be recorded. the company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of 0.7 billion and 2.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and 2023 respectively. the fiscal 2024 charges related to impairments of retail assets content assets and equity investments. the fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information., obligations. we provide eligible employees with pension and other postretirement benefits based on factors such as years of service and compensation level during employment. the pension obligation shown below projected benefit obligation consists of a benefits earned by employees to date based on current salary levels accumulated benefit obligation and b benefits to be received by employees as a result of expected future salary increases. the obligation for medical and life insurance benefits is not affected by future salary increases. the following table shows how the present value of our projected benefit obligations changed during each of the last two years. pension benefits medical and life insurance benefits 2023

196.6 263.2 675.3 21.3 a as of december 31 2023 we had recorded 141.4 million of income tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 act. the transition tax is due in eight annual installments with the first six installments paid in 2018 through 2023. the remaining installment amounts will be equal to 20 of the total liability payable in 2024 and 25 in 2025. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the one-time transition tax. b the amount included in less than 1 year reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans. anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31 2023 was 36.2 million. this amount is impacted by among other items pension expense funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment returns on plan assets. therefore we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.]</td>\n",

1 737.9 million 705.4 million and 915.1 million for the years ended december 31 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively. the increase of 1 032.5 million for the year ended december 31 2023 compared to the year ended december 31 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures the absence of any divestiture activities in 2023 and the remaining payment of 236.3 million related to the acquisition of our efk location. during the years ended december 31 2023 2022 and 2021 we paid 1 575.6 million 1 005.0 million and 444.6 million respectively for capital expenditures. our capital expenditures as a percent of revenue increased in 2023 to 19 primarily as a result of investments to expand sic manufacturing capacity. in 2024 we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 10 - 12 of revenue as these investments along with other capital initiatives are expected to decrease., total company revenue. the increase in organic revenue reflects benefits from higher realized prices and continued demand for companion animal diagnostics globally supported by increases in cag diagnostics recurring revenues. increases in our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging services recurring revenue also contributed to higher revenue supported by demand for subscription-based software. higher revenue in our water business was primarily due to the benefit of price increases and higher testing volumes in certain international regions as well as the benefit of an acquisition in the third quarter of 2022. the decline in our lpd business was primarily due to lower herd health screening volume partially offset by higher realized prices and volume growth in north america europe and south america. the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to lower sales of opti covid-19 pcr testing products and services following the discontinuation of active marketing of such products and services in the first quarter of 2023.the impact of currency movements decreased total revenue growth by 0.2 while the impact of acquisitions increased total revenue growth by 0.1 . the following table presents our total company results of operations for the years ended december 31 change total

recognize gross written premium over the term of the treaty albeit over a different pattern than what was previously used. the refined estimate resulted in an increase of gross written premium for the twelve months ended december 31 2023 period and has further aligned the estimation methodology across the reinsurance division globally. this change had no impact on the total written premium to be recognized over the term of the treaty. there was no impact on net earned premium and therefore no impact on income from continuing operations net income or any related per-share amounts., net income was 2.8 billion for the year ended december 31 2023 compared to 1.3 billion for the year ended december 31 2022. the increase was primarily driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. net interest income increased 2.1 billion from the year ended december 31 2022 primarily due to increases in ftp credit rates on deposits as well as increases in yields on and average balances of loans. these positive impacts were partially offset by increases in rates paid on deposits as well as ftp charge rates on loans. provision for credit losses increased 164 million from the year ended december 31 2022 primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans commercial and industrial loans indirect secured consumer loans and credit card. net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 68 bps for the year ended december 31 2023 compared to 33 bps for the year ended december 31 2022., for the year ended december 31 2023 total revenues were 19 552 million growing 7 or 1 211 million as reported and 8 organically . the reported growth was

threat analysis. our policies and our baseline security controls incorporate robust security infrastructure risk-based controls and multi- layered defense systems. we have 16 system and organization controls type 2 or soc 2 certifications with respect to our information security and infrastructure. our adaptive analysis monitors the threat landscape relevant to nasdaq our vendors and financial industry peers and threats arising from geopolitical events. as the external threat landscape evolves our information security controls are regularly evaluated updated and enhanced to help protect against emerging risks. additionally we conduct extensive cybersecurity assessments of our acquired entities both prior to acquisition and following completion of the transaction to understand potential threats and mitigate any potential security gaps as well as to ensure compliance with our security infrastructure and access management practices and policies. we periodically engage external advisors to perform an analysis of our information security procedures which include a review of program documentation and an overall maturity assessment of nasdaq s information security programs. these advisors provide recommendations to further enhance our procedures. the findings are then presented to the audit risk committee of the board of directors or the audit risk committee. in 2023 our management team and the board of directors conducted tabletop exercises and simulations in cybersecurity matters with assistance from internal and outside experts. we use certain cloud-based third-party vendors for the core trading systems of certain of our exchanges and certain of our governance products and solutions. prior to engaging such vendors we analyze each provider s soc2 certifications and perform due diligence and testing for information security and interoperability with our systems and annually review the soc2 certifications. our security assurance and threat assessment team within our information security organization collaborates with our external threat intelligence providers to proactively review nasdaq and our vendors with respect to emerging threats

marketable securities or other liquid collateral at advance rates consistent with industry standards. the proceeds from repayment or if necessary the liquidation of collateral which is monitored daily are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn against these existing lines of credit. these lines of credit are primarily uncommitted as we reserve the right to not make any advances or may terminate these lines at any time. because many of our lending commitments expire without being funded in whole or in part the contractual amounts are not estimates of our actual future credit exposure or future liquidity requirements. the allowance for credit losses calculated under the cecl model provides for potential losses related to the unfunded lending commitments. see notes 2 and 8 for additional information regarding this allowance for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments. rj a enters into margin lending arrangements which allow clients to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. such loans are extended on a demand basis and are generally not committed facilities. margin loans are collateralized by the securities held in the client s account at rj a. collateral levels and established credit terms are monitored daily and we require clients to deposit additional collateral or reduce balances as necessary., the company s allowance for doubtful accounts which offsets accounts receivable and is included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and bad debts which reduce rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income have historically been very modest particularly in our residential business given the quality of our resident base and asset class. however due to the impact of the novel coronavirus covid-19 pandemic and extended eviction moratoriums enacted during the pandemic the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debts were elevated in 2021 2022 and 2023 though gradually declined throughout 2023. in accordance with the lease standard if we determine the lease payments are not probable of collection based on known troubled accounts rent deferral plans granted historical experience and other currently available evidence we fully reserve for any unpaid amounts deferred rent receivable variable lease payments and straight-line receivable balances and recognize rental income only if cash is received. if we later determine that these lease payments are probable of collection based on sustained clean payment history no deferral plans granted and other currently available evidence we will no longer fully reserve for the respective current receivable balances we will reinstate the straight-line balances for the respective leases and we will no longer recognize rental income only if cash is received. if the company s estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received then the timing and amount of the company s reported revenue could be impacted. see note 8 for additional details., dte energy has approximately 1.8 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2023 consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements. dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs. however virtually all dte energy s businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows. credit ratings credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities. dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets. dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets. however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various non-utility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energy-related products and services. certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade. the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial. also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the non-utility businesses could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity. a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets. the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants. while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews., selected measures of liquidity and

accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging historical and expected collection patterns the financial condition of our customers the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment. for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets and analysis of the

18 305 10 133, we recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. our primary performance obligation the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers which is also when control is transferred. the transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. our policy for dsd including certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. similarly our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. as a result we record reserves based on estimates for product recall anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. our credit terms which are established in accordance with local and industry practices typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the united states and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally and may allow discounts for early payment. we estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility write-off history the aging of accounts receivable our analysis of customer data and forward-looking information including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers. our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. in fact our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. in addition dsd products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. for product delivered through other distribution networks we monitor customer inventory levels. as discussed in our customers in item 1. business we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. total marketplace spending includes sales incentives discounts advertising and other marketing activities. sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf such as payments for in-store displays payments to gain distribution of new products payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. a number of our sales incentives such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates are based on annual targets and accruals are established during the year as products are delivered for the expected payout which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. these accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. in addition certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred., accounts receivable the accounts receivable balance for the years ended december 31 2023 and 2022 was 182.7 million and 184.4 million respectively of which 32.3 million and 59.6 million related to the site development segment respectively. we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. in addition we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable. refer to note 15 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment., commitments

issue letters of credit under its secured receivables credit facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility see note 14 . in support of its risk management program to ensure the company s performance or payment to third parties 72 million in letters of credit under the secured receivables credit facility were outstanding as of december 31 2023. the letters of credit primarily represent collateral for current and future automobile liability and workers compensation loss payments. the company has certain noncancelable commitments primarily under take-or-pay arrangements to purchase products or services from various suppliers mainly for consulting and other service agreements and standing orders to purchase reagents and other laboratory supplies. as of december 31 2023 the approximate total future purchase commitments are 793 million of which 214 million are expected to be incurred in 2024 352 million are expected to be incurred in 2025 through 2026 and the balance thereafter. billing and collection agreement, income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables that are uncollectible. we determine that a financing receivable is uncollectible when based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. we determine a financing receivable is past due when cash has not been received upon the due date specified in the contract. we evaluate the collectability of financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. if a financing receivable is determined to be uncollectible the customer is categorized as non-accrual status. when a customer is in non-accrual status at commencement sales-type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. if we have a note receivable with a customer that is in non-accrual status or a sales-type lease with a customer that changes to non-accrual status after commencement we recognize contractual interest income as payments are received to the extent there is sufficient collateral and payments exceed past due principal payments. residual values which are reviewed periodically represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. for operating leases revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. operating lease assets included in financing receivables and operating lease equipment net are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset. we periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. we record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. we evaluate for impairment assets under operating leases when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. reinsurance revenue our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary astro ltd. participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. the member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk.

2005 long-term incentive plan which authorized the issuance of 6 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options stock appreciation rights unrestricted stock restricted stock units including performance restricted stock and performance units. in 2008 shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 long-term incentive plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 10.5 million and in 2010 shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 long-term incentive plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 17.5 million. in 2015 shareholders approved the 2015 long-term incentive plan which authorized the issuance of 13 million shares. approximately 6 million of these shares were shares that were currently available under the 2005 plan and were incorporated into the 2015 plan upon approval by shareholders. in 2022 shareholders approved the 2022 long-term incentive plan which authorized the issuance of 12 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options stock appreciation rights unrestricted stock restricted stock units including performance restricted stock and performance units. the 2022 long-term incentive plan replaced the 2015 long-term incentive plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 long-term incentive plan and none of the shares that remain available under the 2015 long-term incentive plan are available for issuance under the 2022 long-term incentive plan. awards under long-term incentive plans may be granted to employees and directors. pursuant to the long-term incentive plan we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return tsr performance restricted stock units eps performance restricted stock units strategic performance restricted stock units time-lapse restricted stock units special performance restricted stock units free cash flow fcf performance restricted stock units and unrestricted stock. under the program awards of tsr performance restricted stock units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period a recipient of tsr performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of eps performance restricted stock units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate goal eps cagr performance restricted stock units measured over a three-year period. a recipient of eps cagr performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of eps performance restricted stock units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. during the three-year vesting period a recipient of eps performance restricted stock units earned a total award of either 0 or 100 of the initial grant. awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics net sales and eps growth compared to strategic plan objectives during a three-year period. a recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of fcf performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. an annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. a recipient of fcf performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of time-lapse restricted stock units will vest ratably over the three-year period. in addition we may issue special grants of restricted stock units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. awards are generally granted annually in october. stock options are granted on a selective basis under the long-term incentive plans. the term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. the option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a three-year period. in 2019 we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. we last issued stock options in 2019. in 2024 we issued time-lapse restricted stock units unrestricted stock tsr performance restricted stock units and eps cagr performance restricted stock units. we last issued fcf performance restricted stock units in 2019 eps performance restricted stock units in 2018 strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015. in connection with the sovos brands acquisition we issued 1.721 million time-lapse restricted stock units replacement units in exchange for certain sovos brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. the replacement units are subject to the same terms and conditions of the original sovos brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. certain replacement units were subject to accelerated vesting. the replacement units have a total fair value of 74 million based on the quoted price of our stock on the acquisition date. the portion of replacement units attributed to pre-combination service was 42 million which was accounted for as part of consideration transferred and was recorded in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statements of equity. see note 3 for additional information. the portion of the replacement units attributable to post-combination service will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period. also in connection with the sovos brands acquisition in 2024 our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate goals for the eps cagr performance restricted stock units granted in 2024 2023 and 2022 were revised to equitably adjust for the impact of completed acquisitions and divestitures that were not contemplated at the time of approval of the original targets., humana inc . notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 continued in any spe transactions . the adoption of fin 46 or fin 46-r did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows . in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no . 123r share-based payment or statement 123r which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation . this requirement represents a significant change because fixed-based stock option awards a predominate form of stock compensation for us were not recognized as compensation expense under apb 25 . statement 123r requires the cost of the award as determined on the date of grant at fair value be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period . the grant-date fair value of the award will be estimated using option-pricing models . we are required to adopt statement 123r no later than july 1 2005 under one of three transition methods including a prospective retrospective and combination approach . we previously disclosed on page 67 the effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the black-scholes pricing model for 2004 2003 and 2002 . we currently are evaluating all of the provisions of statement 123r and the expected effect on us including among other items reviewing compensation strategies related to stock-based awards selecting an option pricing model and determining the transition method . in march 2004 the fasb issued eitf issue no . 03-1 or eitf 03-1 the meaning of other-than- temporary impairment and its application to certain investments . eitf 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on certain debt and equity investments when the fair value of the investment security is less than its carrying value . in september 2004 the fasb delayed the previously scheduled third quarter 2004 effective date until the issuance of additional implementation guidance expected in 2005 . upon issuance of a final standard we will evaluate the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations . 3 . acquisitions on february 16 2005 we acquired careplus health plans of florida or careplus as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company . careplus provides medicare advantage hmo plans and benefits to medicare eligible members in miami-dade broward and palm beach counties . this acquisition enhances our medicare market position in south florida . we paid approximately 450 million in cash including estimated transaction costs subject to a balance sheet settlement process with a nine month claims run-out period . we currently are in the process of allocating the purchase price to the net tangible and intangible assets . on april 1 2004 we acquired ochsner health plan or ochsner from the ochsner clinic foundation . ochsner is a louisiana health benefits company offering network-based managed care plans to employer-groups and medicare eligible members . this acquisition enabled us to enter a new market with significant market share which should facilitate new sales opportunities in this and surrounding markets including houston texas . we paid 157.1 million in cash including transaction costs . the fair value of the tangible assets liabilities as of the acquisition date are as follows .

obligations upon the vesting or exercise of previously granted share-based compensation awards. such shares were not repurchased as part of our publicly-announced share repurchase programs and are excluded from the table above. 2 the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization increase of 1.0 billion on april 24 2023. there is no expiration date for this program under which 382.9 million remained available as of december 31 2023. during 2023 we repurchased 13.8 million shares for a total of 1.0 billion under this program. on january 29 2024 the board of directors

earnings per share 1.02 0.16 1.60 1 the effect of the assumed conversion of certain convertible units had an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of net income available to the company s common shareholders per share. accordingly the impact of such conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations. additionally there were 0.3 million stock options that were not dilutive as of december 31 2022. the company s unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents. the impact of the unvested restricted share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted shares participation rights in undistributed earnings., investments prior to our acquisition of keystone on october 12 2007 we held common shares of keystone which were classified as an available-for-sale investment security . accordingly the investment was included in other assets at its fair value with the unrealized gain excluded from earnings and included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes . upon our acquisition of keystone on october 12 2007 the unrealized gain was removed from accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and the original cost of the common shares was considered a component of the purchase price . fair value of financial instruments our debt is reflected on the balance sheet at cost . based on current market conditions our interest rate margins are below the rate available in the market which causes the fair value of our debt to fall below the carrying value . the fair value of our term loans see note 6 201clong-term obligations 201d is approximately 570 million at december 31 2009 as compared to the carrying value of 596 million . we estimated the fair value of our term loans by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume our obligations . the upfront cash payment excluding any issuance costs is the amount that a market participant would be able to lend at december 31 2009 to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under our term loans . the carrying amounts of our cash and equivalents net trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value . we apply the market approach to value our financial assets and liabilities which include the cash surrender value of life insurance deferred compensation liabilities and interest rate swaps . the market approach utilizes available market information to estimate fair value . required fair value disclosures are included in note 8 201cfair value measurements . 201d accrued expenses we self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program . we purchase certain stop-loss insurance to limit our liability exposure . we also self-insure a portion of our property and casualty risk which includes automobile liability general liability workers 2019 compensation and property under deductible insurance programs . the insurance premium costs are expensed over the contract periods . a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost which is calculated using analyses of historical data . we monitor new claims and claim development as well as trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves . self-insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets are net of claims deposits of 0.7 million and 0.8 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively . while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our insurance reserves and corresponding expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and assumptions . product warranties some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects . we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses . the changes in the warranty reserve are as follows in thousands . balance as of january 1 2008 580 warranty expense 3681 warranty claims -3721

the company 2019s total net sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively . the retail segment 2019s operating income was 4.7 billion 3.2 billion and 2.3 billion during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively . these year-over-year increases in retail operating income were primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during the respective years . gross margin gross margin for 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages . 2012 2011 2010 net sales 156508 108249 65225 cost of sales 87846 64431 39541 gross margin 68662 43818 25684 gross margin percentage 43.9 43.9 40.5 40.5 39.4 39.4 the gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9 43.9 compared to 40.5 40.5 in 2011 . this year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales . the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger u.s . dollar . the gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9 45.9 compared to 41.4 41.4 during the second half of 2012 . the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales . additionally gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers price reductions on certain existing products higher transition costs associated with product launches and continued strengthening of the u.s . dollar partially offset by lower commodity costs . the gross margin percentage in 2011 was 40.5 40.5 compared to 39.4 39.4 in 2010 . this year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs . the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2012 and the company anticipates gross margin of about 36 36 during the first quarter of 2013 . expected future declines in gross margin are largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases . future strengthening of the u.s . dollar could further negatively impact gross margin . the foregoing statements regarding the company 2019s expected gross margin percentage in future periods including the first quarter of 2013 are forward-looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including but not limited to those set forth above in part i item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading 201crisk factors 201d and those described in this paragraph . in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company 2019s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins . in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins . gross margins could also be affected by the company 2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products . due to the company 2019s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. ., aeronautics business segment 2019s results of operations discussion . the increase in our consolidated net adjustments for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily was due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our is gs and aeronautics business segments . aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research design development manufacture integration sustainment support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft including combat and air mobility aircraft unmanned air vehicles and related technologies . aeronautics 2019 major programs include the f-35 lightning ii joint strike fighter f-22 raptor f-16 fighting falcon c-130 hercules and the c-5m super galaxy . aeronautics 2019 operating results included the following in millions . 2012 2011 2010 net sales 14953 14362 13109 operating profit 1699 1630 1498 operating margins 11.4 11.4 11.3 11.3 11.4 11.4 backlog at year-end 30100 30500 27500 2012 compared to 2011 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2012 increased 591 million or 4 4 compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately 745 million from f-35 lrip contracts principally due to increased production volume about 285 million from f-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries 37 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to 22 in 2011 partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers and approximately 140 million from c-5 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries four c-5m aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to two in 2011 . partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately 365 million from decreased production volume and lower risk retirements on the f-22 program as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of 2012 approximately 110 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 and to a lesser extent lower volume and about 95 million from a decrease in volume on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to higher volume . net sales for c-130 programs were comparable to 2011 as a decline in sustainment activities largely was offset by increased aircraft deliveries . aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2012 increased 69 million or 4 4 compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately 105 million from c-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements about 50 million from f-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements approximately 50 million from f-35 lrip contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements and about 50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain f-16 contracts . partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about 90 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception- to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 approximately 50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the f-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 and approximately 45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume . operating profit for c-5 programs was comparable to 2011 . adjustments not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above were approximately 30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011 . 2011 compared to 2010 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2011 increased 1.3 billion or 10 10 compared to 2010 . the growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about 850 million for work performed on the f-35 lrip contracts as production increased higher volume of about 745 million for c-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries 33 c-130j aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010 and support activities about 425 million for f-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries 22 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010 and approximately 90 million for higher volume on c-5 programs two c-5m aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to one during 2010 . these increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately 675 million due to lower volume on the f-22 program and lower net sales of about 155 million for the f-35 development contract as development work decreased. ., aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2011 increased 132 million or 9 9 compared to 2010 . the increase primarily was attributable to approximately 115 million of higher operating profit on c-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks increased volume and risk retirements on f-16 programs of about 50 million and c-5 programs of approximately 20 million and about 70 million due to risk retirements on other aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011 . these increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately 75 million on the f-22 program and f-35 development contract primarily due to lower volume and about 55 million on other programs including f-35 lrip primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in 2011 compared to 2010 . adjustments not related to volume including net profit rate adjustments described above were approximately 90 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 . backlog backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to lower orders on f-35 contracts and c-130 programs partially offset by higher orders on f-16 programs . backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to higher orders on f-35 contracts which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the c-130 programs . trends we expect aeronautics will experience a mid single digit percentage range decline in net sales for 2013 as compared to 2012 . a decrease in net sales from a decline in f-16 and c-130j aircraft deliveries is expected to be partially offset by an increase in net sales volume on f-35 lrip contracts . operating profit is projected to decrease at a high single digit percentage range from 2012 levels due to the expected decline in net sales as well as changes in aircraft mix resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years . information systems global solutions our is gs business segment provides management services integrated information technology solutions and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil defense intelligence and other government customers . is gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments . is gs has been impacted by the continuing downturn in the federal information technology budgets and the impact of the continuing resolution that was effective on october 1 2012 the start of the u.s . government 2019s fiscal year . is gs 2019 operating results included the following in millions . 2012 2011 2010 net sales 8846 9381 9921 operating profit 808 874 814 operating margins 9.1 9.1 9.3 9.3 8.2 8.2 backlog at year-end 8700 9300 9700 2012 compared to 2011 is gs 2019 net sales for 2012 decreased 535 million or 6 6 compared to 2011 . the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately 485 million due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2011 primarily jtrs odin and u.k . census and about 255 million due to lower volume on numerous other programs primarily hanford warfighter information network-tactical win-t command control battle management and communications c2bmc and transportation worker identification credential twic . partially offsetting the decreases were higher net sales of approximately 140 million from qtc which was acquired early in the fourth quarter of 2011 and about 65 million from increased activity on numerous other programs primarily federal cyber security programs and persistent threat detection system ptds operational support . is gs 2019 operating profit for 2012 decreased 66 million or 8 8 compared to 2011 . the decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately 50 million due to the favorable impact of the odin contract completion in 2011 about 25 million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in 2012 and approximately 20 million due to lower volume on certain programs primarily c2bmc and win-t . partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately 15 million from the twic program and about 10 million due to increased activity on numerous other programs primarily federal cyber security programs and ptds operational support . operating profit for the jtrs program was comparable as a decrease in volume was offset by a decrease in reserves . adjustments not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above were approximately 20 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. ., table of contents research and development expense 201cr d 201d r d expense increased 34 34 or 449 million to 1.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 . this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded r d activities . also contributing to this increase in r d expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software development costs of 71 million related to mac os x snow leopard . although total r d expense increased 34 34 during 2010 it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52 52 year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010 . the company continues to believe that focused investments in r d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company 2019s core business strategy . as such the company expects to make further investments in r d to remain competitive . r d expense increased 20 20 or 224 million to 1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 . this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2009 to support expanded r d activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses . additionally 71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from r d expense during 2009 compared to 11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008 . although total r d expense increased 20 20 during 2009 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14 14 increase in revenue in 2009 . selling general and administrative expense 201csg a 201d sg a expense increased 1.4 billion or 33 33 to 5.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 . this increase was due primarily to the company 2019s continued expansion of its retail segment higher spending on marketing and advertising programs increased stock-based compensation expenses and variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company 2019s net sales . sg a expenses increased 388 million or 10 10 to 4.1 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 . this increase was due primarily to the company 2019s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on marketing and advertising . other income and expense other income and expense for the three years ended september 25 2010 are as follows in millions total other income and expense decreased 171 million or 52 52 to 155 million during 2010 compared to 326 million and 620 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively . the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year- over-year basis partially offset by the company 2019s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances . the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 0.75 0.75 1.43 1.43 and 3.44 3.44 during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively . additionally the company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts which further reduced the total other income and expense . during 2010 2009 and 2008 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense . provision for income taxes the company 2019s effective tax rates were 24 24 32 32 and 32 32 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively . the company 2019s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 35 due . 2010 2009 2008

report compared with 57 million for 2009 . decreases in cio and mort- gage banking var for 2010 were again driven by the decline in market volatility and position changes . the decline in mortgage banking var at december 31 2010 reflects management 2019s deci- sion to reduce risk given market volatility at the time . the firm 2019s average ib and other var diversification benefit was 59 million or 37 37 of the sum for 2010 compared with 82 million or 28 28 of the sum for 2009 . the firm experienced an increase in the diversification benefit in 2010 as positions changed and correla- tions decreased . in general over the course of the year var expo- sure can vary significantly as positions change market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change . var back-testing the

organic revenue reflects benefits from higher realized prices and continued demand for companion animal diagnostics globally supported by increases in cag diagnostics recurring revenues. increases in our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging services recurring revenue also contributed to higher revenue supported by demand for subscription-based software. higher revenue in our water business was primarily due to the benefit of price increases and higher testing volumes in certain international regions as well as the benefit of an acquisition in the third quarter of 2022. the decline in our lpd business was primarily due to lower herd health screening volume partially offset by higher realized prices and volume growth in north america europe and south america. the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to lower sales of opti covid-19 pcr testing products and services following the discontinuation of active marketing of such products and services in the first quarter of

growth was primarily due to sales of products growing 9 or 1 083 million as reported with growth across all segments. the segment revenues were as follows imaging segment revenues were 10 581 million growing 6 or 596 million as reported due to an increase in organic revenue partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. organic revenue grew 7 primarily due to growth in magnetic resonance and mi ct product lines due to supply chain fulfillment improvements new product introductions and an increase in price ultrasound segment revenues were 3 457 million growing 1 or 35 million as reported due to an increase in organic revenue partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. organic revenue grew 2 primarily due to growth in cardiovascular and point of care and handheld product lines due to new product introductions an increase in price and supply chain fulfillment improvements pcs segment revenues were 3 142 million growing 8 or 226 million due to growth in monitoring solutions and consumables and services product lines driven by an increase in price and operational improvements and pdx segment revenues were 2 306 million growing 18 or 348 million with growth across all regions due to an increase in price and improved demand. the regional revenues were as follows, greater china segment net sales from greater china decreased by 40.8 million or 2 for the year ended december 31 2023 when compared to the prior year. this decrease was the result of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 87.1 million or 4 . constant currency net sales increased by approximately 46.3 million or 2 when compared to the prior year driven primarily by increased volumes of existing products. divestitures did not have a significant impact on the net sales during the year ended december 31 2023. janz segment net sales from janz decreased by 207.9 million or 13 for the year ended december 31 2023 when compared to the prior year. this decrease was partially the result of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 96.2 million or 6 . net sales also decreased by approximately 18.8 million or 1 due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2022 and 2023. constant currency net sales from the remaining business decreased by approximately 92.9 million or 6 when compared to the prior year. the decrease was due to lower net sales of existing products mainly driven by lower pricing and to a lesser extent volumes in japan as a result of government price reductions and additional competition and lower volumes of existing products in australia. emerging markets segment net sales from emerging markets decreased by 64.0 million or 2 for

self-storage square footage in the u.s. and that collectively the four largest self-storage owners in the u.s. own approximately 20 with the remaining 80 owned by regional and local operators. we believe our public storage brand awareness as well as the innovative improvements we have made to the customer experience described below provide us with a competitive advantage in acquiring and retaining customers relative to other self-storage operators. the high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators who use marketing channels including internet advertising signage and banners and offer services similar to ours. as a result competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels rental rates rental income and operating expenses of our facilities. however we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business result in our being able to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale., 201cati 201d and spectrasite

of goods sold -29 29 476 122 selling general and administrative expenses 244 382 18 research and development expenses 86 127 39 total 301 985 179 effective january 1 2018 we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to the presentation of net periodic pension and opeb costs . this guidance requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost . service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period . the other components of net benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations . as a result components of pension and opeb costs other than service costs will be reclassified from operating costs to other income expense . this change will be applied retrospectively to prior years . in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our u.s . pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants . as of december 31 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 290 million . in the fourth quarter of 2016 the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the soa for our u.s . pension and opeb plans . as of december 31 2016 this resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 200 million . in the first quarter of 2017 we announced the closure of our gosselies belgium facility . this announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a curtailment and the recognition of termination benefits . in march 2017 we recognized a net loss of 20 million for the curtailment and termination benefits . in addition we announced the decision to phase out production at our aurora illinois facility which resulted in termination benefits of 9 million for certain hourly employees that participate in our u.s . hourly defined benefit pension plan . beginning in 2016 we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows . service and interest costs in 2017 and 2016 were lower by 140 million and 180 million respectively under the new method than they would have been under the previous method . this change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and opeb obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss gain reported for the respective year . we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses to decrease approximately 80 million in 2018 . this decrease is primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets as a result of a higher asset base in 2018 . in general our strategy for both the u.s . and the non-u.s . pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities while reducing risk in our portfolio . for our u.s . pension plans our year-end 2017 asset allocation was 34 a0percent equities 62 a0percent fixed income and 4 percent other . our current u.s . pension target asset allocation is 30 percent equities and 70 percent fixed income . the target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives . the u.s . plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis . the year-end 2017 asset allocation for our non-u.s . pension plans was 40 a0percent equities 53 a0percent fixed income 4 a0percent real estate and 3 percent other . the 2017 weighted-average target allocations for our non-u.s . pension plans was 38 a0percent equities 54 a0percent fixed income 5 a0percent real estate and 3 a0percent other . the target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements demographics of the plan participants and funded status . the frequency of rebalancing for the non-u.s . plans varies depending on the plan . contributions to our pension and opeb plans were 1.6 billion and 329 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively . the 2017 contributions include a 1.0 billion discretionary contribution made to our u.s . pension plans in december 2017 . we expect to make approximately 365 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2018 . we believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and opeb plans . 48 2017 form 10-k .,

the 201csavings plans 201d that cover substantially all domestic employees . the savings plans permit participants to make contributions on a pre-tax and or after-tax basis and allow participants to choose among various investment alternatives . we match a portion of participant contributions based upon their years of service . amounts expensed for the savings plans for 2018 2017 and 2016 were 52.6 47.2 and 47.0 respectively . expenses include a discretionary company contribution of 6.7 3.6 and 6.1 offset by participant forfeitures of 5.8 4.6 and 4.4 in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively . in addition we maintain defined contribution plans in various foreign countries and contributed 51.3 47.4 and 44.5 to these plans in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively . deferred compensation and benefit arrangements we have deferred compensation and benefit arrangements which i permit certain of our key officers and employees to defer a portion of their salary or incentive compensation or ii require us to contribute an amount to the participant 2019s account . these arrangements may provide participants with the amounts deferred plus interest upon attaining certain conditions such as completing a certain number of years of service attaining a certain age or upon retirement or termination . as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the deferred compensation and deferred benefit liability balance was 196.2 and 213.2 respectively . amounts expensed for deferred compensation and benefit arrangements in 2018 2017 and 2016 were 10.0 18.5 and 18.5 respectively . we have purchased life insurance policies on participants 2019 lives to assist in the funding of the related deferred compensation and deferred benefit liabilities . as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the cash surrender value of these policies was 177.3 and 177.4 respectively . long-term disability plan we have a long-term disability plan which provides income replacement benefits to eligible participants who are unable to perform their job duties or any job related to his or her education training or experience . as all income replacement benefits are fully insured no related obligation is required as of december 31 2018 and 2017 . in addition to income replacement benefits plan participants may remain covered for certain health and life insurance benefits up to normal retirement age and accordingly we have recorded an obligation of 5.9 and 8.4 as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively. ., we have material cash requirements for known contractual obligations and commitments in the form of finance leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities that are disclosed in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and discussed below. we expect to fund these obligations and other discretionary payments including expected returns to shareowners primarily through cash from operations. we anticipate making discretionary contributions to our company-sponsored u.s. defined benefit pension and postretirement medical benefit plans of approximately 1.3 billion in 2024 which are included within expected employer contributions to plan trusts shown in note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements. there are currently no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified u.s. pension plans in 2024. the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including plan asset returns discount rates other actuarial assumptions changes to pension plan funding regulations and the discretionary contributions that we make. actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2024 cannot be reasonably estimated. we expect contributions to the ups 401 k savings plan to be approximately 670 million in 2024. as discussed in note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any surcharges or minimum contributions outside of our agreed-upon contractual rates with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate. contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process. we have outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that are discussed in note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements. additionally we have 1.5 billion of fixed- and floating-rate senior notes that mature in 2024. we intend to repay or refinance these amounts when due. estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt total approximately 14.7 billion. this amount was calculated using the contractual interest payments due on our fixed- and variable-rate debt based on interest rates as of december 31 2023. for debt denominated in a foreign currency the u.s. dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to project future interest payments. annual principal payments on our long-term debt and purchase commitments for certain capital expenditures are also set out in note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements. included within these purchase commitments are firm commitments to purchase 21 new boeing 767-300 aircraft to be delivered between 2024 and 2026 and two used boeing 747-8f aircraft to be delivered in 2024. additionally we anticipate purchasing approximately 3 000 alternative fuel vehicles in 2024. in addition to purchase commitments we have other contractual agreements including equipment rentals software licensing and commodity contracts. our finance lease obligations including purchase options that are reasonably certain to be exercised relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate. these obligations together with our obligations under operating leases are set out in note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements. under provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act we elected to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries over eight years. the remaining balance will be paid between 2024 and 2026. additionally we have uncertain tax positions that are further discussed in note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements. as discussed in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2023 we had a restricted cash balance related to certain tax and regulatory matters in italy. we anticipate this balance will increase by approximately 61 million in 2024., 2017 form 10-k 115 and 1088 million respectively were primarily comprised of loans to dealers and the spc 2019s liabilities of 1106 million and 1087 million respectively were primarily comprised of commercial paper . the assets of the spc are not available to pay cat financial 2019s creditors . cat financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the spc experiences losses . no loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement . cat financial is party to agreements in the normal course of business with selected customers and caterpillar dealers in which they commit to provide a set dollar amount of financing on a pre- approved basis . they also provide lines of credit to certain customers and caterpillar dealers of which a portion remains unused as of the end of the period . commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses . it has been cat financial 2019s experience that not all commitments and lines of credit will be used . management applies the same credit policies when making commitments and granting lines of credit as it does for any other financing . cat financial does not require collateral for these commitments lines but if credit is extended collateral may be required upon funding . the amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for dealers as of december 31 2017 and 2016 was 10993 million and 12775 million respectively . the amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for customers as of december 31 2017 and 2016 was 3092 million and 3340 million respectively . our product warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory . generally historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model engine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america . specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. . millions of dollars 2017 2016 warranty liability january 1 1258 1354 reduction in

state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions . in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines . we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards . we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws . when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings . costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience . where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum . where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs . in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others . we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis . the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expenses . we believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required . on january 7 2015 the company received a grand jury subpoena from the u.s . district court for the central district of illinois . the subpoena requests documents and information from the company relating to among other things financial information concerning u.s . and non-u.s . caterpillar subsidiaries including undistributed profits of non-u.s . subsidiaries and the movement of cash among u.s . and non-u.s . subsidiaries . the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to among other things the purchase and resale of replacement parts by caterpillar inc . and non-u.s . caterpillar subsidiaries dividend distributions of certain non-u.s . caterpillar subsidiaries and caterpillar sarl and related structures . on march 2-3 2017 agents with the department of commerce the federal deposit insurance corporation and the internal revenue service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the company in the peoria illinois area including its former corporate headquarters . the warrants identify and agents seized documents and information related to among other things the export of products from the united states the movement of products between the united states and switzerland the relationship between caterpillar inc . and caterpillar sarl and sales outside the united states . it is the company 2019s understanding that the warrants which concern both tax and export activities are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation . the company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation . the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company 2019s consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity . on march 20 2014 brazil 2019s administrative council for economic defense cade published a technical opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants including two subsidiaries of caterpillar inc. mge - equipamentos e servi e7os ferrovi e1rios ltda . mge and caterpillar brasil ltda . the publication of the technical opinion opened cade 2019s official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance

equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity . equity securities equity securities are valued at the closing market price reported on a u.s . or international exchange where the security is actively traded and are therefore classified as level 1 assets . equity mutual and pooled funds shares of mutual funds are valued at the net asset value nav of the fund and are classified as level 1 assets . units of pooled funds are valued at the per unit nav determined by the fund manager based on the value of the underlying traded holdings and are classified as level 2 assets . corporate and government bonds corporate and government bonds are classified as level 2 assets as they are either valued at quoted market prices from observable pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields and credit ratings . other pooled funds other pooled funds classified as level 2 assets are valued at the nav of the shares held at year end which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments . securities and interests classified as level 3 are carried at the estimated fair value . the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment values which includes estimated bids from brokers or other third-party vendor sources that utilize expected cash flow streams and other uncorroborated data including counterparty credit quality default risk discount rates and the overall capital market liquidity . insurance contracts insurance contracts are classified as level 3 assets as they are carried at contract value which approximates the estimated fair value . the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of the insurance company and discount rates that require inputs with limited observability . contributions and projected benefit payments pension contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans for fiscal year 2018 were 68.3 . contributions for funded plans resulted primarily from contractual and regulatory requirements . benefit payments to unfunded plans were due primarily to the timing of retirements . we anticipate contributing 45 to 65 to the defined benefit pension plans in fiscal year 2019 . these contributions are anticipated to be driven primarily by contractual and regulatory requirements for funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans which are dependent upon timing of retirements . projected benefit payments which reflect expected future service are as follows . u.s . international 2019 165.5 52.8 2020 152.4 53.9 2021 157.0 55.6 2022 163.7 56.0 2023 167.9 60.6 2024-2028 900.2 336.8 these estimated benefit payments are based on

retirement healthcare plan as part of our acquisition of allied . this plan provides continued medical coverage for certain former employees following their retirement including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements . eligibility for this plan is limited to certain of those employees who had ten or more years of service and were age 55 or older as of december 31 1998 and certain employees in california who were hired on or before december 31 2005 and who retire on or after age 55 with at least thirty years of service . liabilities acquired for this plan were 1.2 million and 1.3 million respectively at the acquisition date and at december 31 2008 . multi-employer pension plans we contribute to 25 multi-employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements covering union- represented employees . we acquired responsibility for contributions for a portion of these plans as part of our acquisition of allied . approximately 22 22 of our total current employees are participants in such multi- employer plans . these plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers . we do not administer these multi-employer plans . in general these plans are managed by a board of trustees with the unions appointing certain trustees and other contributing employers of the plan appointing certain members . we generally are not represented on the board of trustees . we do not have current plan financial information from the plans 2019 administrators but based on the information available to us it is possible that some of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute may be underfunded . the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding . until the plan trustees develop the funding improvement plans or rehabilitation plans as required by the pension protection act we are unable to determine the amount of assessments we may be subject to if any . accordingly we cannot determine at this time the impact that the pension protection act may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows . furthermore under current law regarding multi-employer benefit plans a plan 2019s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any under-funded multi-employer pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi- employer plan 2019s unfunded vested liabilities . it is possible that there may be a mass withdrawal of employers contributing to these plans or plans may terminate in the near future . we could have adjustments to our estimates for these matters in the near term that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows . our pension expense for multi-employer plans was 21.8 million 18.9 million and 17.3 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively . republic services inc . and subsidiaries notes to

following contractual obligations outstanding fixed-rate debt maturing at various times with an aggregate principal amount of 5.7 billion of which 750 million is due in 2024. depending on the conditions in the credit markets we may refinance this debt or we may use cash from operations and temporarily access our credit facility or term loan facility to repay this debt. future interest payments on our debt total 716.7 million of which 155.4 million is payable in 2024. the liability for our operating and finance lease payments is 1 492.5 million of which 309.3 million is due in 2024. the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is 224.3 million and the liability for our postemployment arrangements is 142.2 million. in 2023 we contributed 8.8 million to our defined benefit plans and paid 10.9 million for our postemployment arrangements. we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2024. the liability for contingent purchase price payments earn-outs is 229.5 million of which 62.4 million is payable in 2024. the remaining balance for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings imposed by the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 is 68.9 million of which 27.7 million is payable in 2024. based on past performance and current expectations we believe that net cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our non-discretionary cash requirements for the next twelve months. in addition and over the longer term our credit facility and term loan facility are available to fund our working capital and contractual obligations., the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for our revenue recognition policies. pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increase. the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. the guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. we decreased our discount rate to 5.06 at the end of fiscal 2024 from 5.94 at the end of fiscal 2023 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2024 year-end measurement date. the company s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2025 by approximately 0.2 billion and would increase the projected benefit obligation at september 28 2024 by approximately 2.4 billion. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately 0.2 billion and 2.1 billion respectively. to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. our expected return on plan assets is 7.25 . a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. a one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2025 annual expense by approximately 168 million. goodwill other intangible assets long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require on an interim basis. the company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. to test goodwill for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. if it is a quantitative assessment is required. alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. the impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units determining whether reporting units should be aggregated the assignment of assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. in fiscal 2024 we determined that our entertainment businesses including dtc services linear networks and content sales licensing should be aggregated into a single reporting unit due to their interdependencies including shared operating costs such as content marketing and technology the similarity of products and services delivered customers served and distribution channels used and projected long term financial performance e.g. operating margins . for our annual impairment test we bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment. to determine the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flows corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators as well as industry growth projections. discount rates are determined based on the inherent risks of the underlying operations. significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model used to determine fair value relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses operating margins terminal growth rates and discount rates. we believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our businesses. changes to these assumptions and shifts in market trends or macroeconomic events could impact test results in the future. as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 the company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of 0.7 billion and 0.6 billion respectively related to our entertainment linear networks reporting unit prior to aggregating all of our entertainment reporting units into a single reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. the carrying amount of the aggregated entertainment reporting unit goodwill after these impairments is approximately 51 billion. after the impairments the fair value of the entertainment reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount by less than 10 . an approximate 40 basis point increase in the discount rate or an approximate 6 reduction in projected annual cash flows used to determine the fair value of the entertainment reporting unit would effectively eliminate the excess fair value over carrying amount. to test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. if it is a quantitative assessment is required. alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows. the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate. the company tests long-lived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. once a triggering event has occurred the impairment test employed is based on whether the company s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. an asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. for assets held for sale to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset s fair value less costs to sell an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions including whether a triggering event has occurred the identification of asset groups estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the company recorded 1.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to the star india transaction in fiscal 2024 to reflect star india at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. the company has investments in equity securities. for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. if these forecasts are not met impairment charges may be recorded. the company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of 0.7 billion and 2.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and 2023 respectively. the fiscal 2024 charges related to impairments of retail assets content assets and equity investments. the fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information., obligations. we provide eligible employees with pension and other postretirement benefits based on factors such as years of service and compensation level during employment. the pension obligation shown below projected benefit obligation consists of a benefits earned by employees to date based on current salary levels accumulated

196.6 263.2 675.3 21.3 a as of december 31 2023 we had recorded 141.4 million of income tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 act. the transition tax is due in eight annual installments with the first six installments paid in 2018 through 2023. the remaining installment amounts will be equal to 20 of the total liability payable in 2024 and 25 in 2025. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the one-time transition tax. b the amount included in less than 1 year reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans. anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31 2023 was 36.2 million. this amount is impacted by among other items pension expense funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment returns on plan assets. therefore we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.]   \n",

unrestricted stock restricted stock units including performance restricted stock and performance units. in 2008 shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 long-term incentive plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 10.5 million and in 2010 shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 long-term incentive plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 17.5 million. in 2015 shareholders approved the 2015 long-term incentive plan which authorized the issuance of 13 million shares. approximately 6 million of these shares were shares that were currently available under the 2005 plan and were incorporated into the 2015 plan upon approval by shareholders. in 2022 shareholders approved the 2022 long-term incentive plan which authorized the issuance of 12 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options stock appreciation rights unrestricted stock restricted stock units including performance restricted stock and performance units. the 2022 long-term incentive plan replaced the 2015 long-term incentive plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 long-term incentive plan and none of the shares that remain available under the 2015 long-term incentive plan are available for issuance under the 2022 long-term incentive plan. awards under long-term incentive plans may be granted to employees and directors. pursuant to the long-term incentive plan we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return tsr performance restricted stock units eps performance restricted stock units strategic performance restricted stock units time-lapse restricted stock units special performance restricted stock units free cash flow fcf performance restricted stock units and unrestricted stock. under the program awards of tsr performance restricted stock units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period a recipient of tsr performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of eps performance restricted stock units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate goal eps cagr performance restricted stock units measured over a three-year period. a recipient of eps cagr performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of eps performance restricted stock units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. during the three-year vesting period a recipient of eps performance restricted stock units earned a total award of either 0 or 100 of the initial grant. awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics net sales and eps growth compared to strategic plan objectives during a three-year period. a recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of fcf performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. an annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. a recipient of fcf performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of time-lapse restricted stock units will vest ratably over the three-year period. in addition we may issue special grants of restricted stock units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. awards are generally granted annually in october. stock options are granted on a selective basis under the long-term incentive plans. the term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. the option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a three-year period. in 2019 we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. we last issued stock options in 2019. in 2024 we issued time-lapse restricted stock units unrestricted stock tsr performance restricted stock units and eps cagr performance restricted stock units. we last issued fcf performance restricted stock units in 2019 eps performance restricted stock units in 2018 strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015. in connection with the sovos brands acquisition we issued 1.721 million time-lapse restricted stock units replacement units in exchange for certain sovos brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. the replacement units are subject to the same terms and conditions of the original sovos brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. certain replacement units were subject to accelerated vesting. the replacement units have a total fair value of 74 million based on the quoted price of our stock on the acquisition date. the portion of replacement units attributed to pre-combination service was 42 million which was accounted for as part of consideration transferred and was recorded in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statements of equity. see note 3 for additional information. the portion of the replacement units attributable to post-combination service will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period. also in connection with the sovos brands acquisition in 2024 our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate goals for the eps cagr performance restricted stock units granted in 2024 2023 and 2022 were revised to equitably adjust for the impact of completed acquisitions and divestitures that were not contemplated at the time of approval of the original targets., humana inc . notes to consolidated

december 2004 the fasb issued statement no . 123r share-based payment or statement 123r which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation . this requirement represents a significant change because fixed-based stock option awards a predominate form of stock compensation for us were not recognized as compensation expense under apb 25 . statement 123r requires the cost of the award as determined on the date of grant at fair value be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period . the grant-date fair value of the award will be estimated using option-pricing models . we are required to adopt statement 123r no later than july 1 2005 under one of three transition methods including a prospective retrospective and combination approach . we previously disclosed on page 67 the effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the black-scholes pricing model for 2004 2003 and 2002 . we currently are evaluating all of the provisions of statement 123r and the expected effect on us including among other items reviewing compensation strategies related to stock-based awards selecting an option pricing model and determining the transition method . in march 2004 the fasb issued eitf issue no . 03-1 or eitf 03-1 the meaning of other-than- temporary impairment and its application to certain investments . eitf 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on certain debt and equity investments when the fair value of the investment security is less than its carrying value . in september 2004 the fasb delayed the previously scheduled third quarter 2004 effective date until

the company s common shareholders per share. accordingly the impact of such conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations. additionally there were 0.3 million stock options that were not dilutive as of december 31 2022. the company s unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents. the impact of the unvested restricted share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted shares participation rights in undistributed earnings., investments prior to our acquisition of keystone on october 12 2007 we held common shares of keystone which were classified as an available-for-sale investment security . accordingly the investment was included in other assets at its fair value with the unrealized gain excluded from earnings and included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes . upon our acquisition of keystone on october 12 2007 the unrealized gain was removed from accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes and the original cost of the common shares was considered a component of the purchase price . fair value of financial instruments our debt is reflected on the balance sheet at cost . based on current market conditions our interest rate margins are below the rate available in the market which causes the fair value of our debt to fall below the carrying value . the fair value of our term loans see note 6 201clong-term obligations 201d is approximately 570 million at december 31 2009 as compared to the carrying value of 596 million . we estimated the fair value of our term loans by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume our obligations . the upfront cash payment excluding any issuance costs is the amount that a market participant would be able to lend at december 31 2009 to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under our term loans . the carrying amounts of our cash and equivalents net trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value . we apply the market approach to value our financial assets and liabilities which include the cash surrender value of life insurance deferred compensation liabilities and interest rate swaps . the market approach utilizes available market information to estimate fair value . required fair value disclosures are included in note 8 201cfair value measurements . 201d accrued expenses we self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program . we purchase certain stop-loss insurance to limit our liability exposure . we also self-insure a portion of our property and casualty risk which includes automobile liability general liability workers 2019 compensation and property under deductible insurance programs . the insurance premium costs are expensed over the contract periods . a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost which is calculated using analyses of historical data . we monitor new claims and claim development as well as trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves . self-insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets are net of claims deposits of 0.7 million and 0.8 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively . while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our insurance reserves and corresponding expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and assumptions . product warranties some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects . we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses . the changes in the warranty reserve are as follows in thousands . balance as of january 1 2008 580 warranty expense 3681

power and capacity to wholesale customers day-ahead sales of energy in a market administered by an iso operation and management services fees and amortization of a below-market ppa. in 2022 and 2021 the majority of revenues were from the palisades nuclear power plant located in michigan which was shut down in may 2022 and subsequently sold in june 2022. almost all of the palisades nuclear plant output was sold under a 15-year ppa with consumers energy which was executed as part of the acquisition of the plant in 2007 and expired in april 2022. prices under the original ppa ranged from 43.50 mwh in 2007 to 61.50 mwh in 2022 and the average price under the ppa was 51 mwh. entergy executed an additional ppa to cover the period from the expiration of the original ppa through final shutdown in may 2022 at a price of 24.14 mwh. entergy issued monthly invoices to consumers energy for electric sales based on the actual output of electricity and related services provided during the previous month at the contract price. the ppa was at below-market prices at the time of the acquisition and entergy amortized a liability to revenue over the life of the agreement. the amount amortized each period was based upon the present value calculated at the date of acquisition of each year s difference between revenue under the agreement and revenue based on estimated market prices. amounts amortized to revenue were 5 million in 2022 and 12 million in 2021. see note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the sale of the palisades plant. practical expedients and exceptions,

entergy new orleans as a result of a stipulation approved by the city council . 2003 compared to 2002 net revenue which is entergy s measure of gross margin consists of operating revenues net of 1 fuel fuel-related and purchased power expenses and 2 other regulatory credits . following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2003 to 2002. . in millions 2002 net revenue 4209.6 base rate increases 66.2 base rate decreases -23.3 23.3 deferred fuel cost revisions 56.2 asset retirement obligation 42.9 net wholesale revenue 23.2 march 2002 ark . settlement agreement -154.0 154.0 other -6.3 6.3 2003 net revenue 4214.5 base rates increased net revenue due to base rate increases at entergy mississippi and entergy new orleans that became effective in january 2003 and june 2003 respectively . entergy gulf states implemented base rate decreases in its louisiana jurisdiction effective june 2002 and january 2003 . the january 2003 base rate decrease of 22.1 million had a minimal impact on net income due to a corresponding reduction in nuclear depreciation and decommissioning expenses associated with the change in accounting estimate to reflect an assumed extension of river bend s useful life . the deferred fuel cost revisions variance was due to a revised unbilled sales pricing estimate made in december 2002 and further revision of that estimate in the first quarter of 2003 to more closely align the fuel component of that pricing with expected recoverable fuel costs at entergy louisiana . the asset retirement obligation variance was due to the implementation of sfas 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations adopted in january 2003 . see critical accounting estimates 2013 nuclear decommissioning costs for more details on sfas 143 . the increase was offset by increased depreciation and decommissioning expenses and had an insignificant effect on net income . the increase in net wholesale revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales volume to municipal and cooperative customers . the march 2002 settlement agreement variance reflects the absence in 2003 of the effect of recording the ice storm settlement approved by the apsc in 2002 . this settlement resulted in previously deferred revenues at entergy arkansas per the transition cost account mechanism being recorded in net revenue in the second quarter of 2002 . the decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses and had a minimal effect on net income . gross operating revenues and regulatory credits gross operating revenues include an increase in fuel cost recovery revenues of 682 million and 53 million in electric and gas sales respectively primarily due to higher fuel rates in 2003 resulting from increases in the market prices of purchased power and natural gas . as such this revenue increase was offset by increased fuel and purchased power expenses. ., entergy corporation and subsidiaries consolidated

       "      <td>[capital resources and liquidity capital resources overview capital has historically been generated by earnings from citi 2019s operating businesses . citi may also augment its capital through issuances of common stock convertible preferred stock preferred stock equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans and in the case of regulatory capital through the issuance of subordinated debt underlying trust preferred securities . in addition the impact of future events on citi 2019s business results such as corporate and asset dispositions as well as changes in accounting standards also affect citi 2019s capital levels . generally capital is used primarily to support assets in citi 2019s businesses and to absorb market credit or operational losses . while capital may be used for other purposes such as to pay dividends or repurchase common stock citi 2019s ability to utilize its capital for these purposes is currently restricted due to its agreements with the u.s . government generally for so long as the u.s . government continues to hold citi 2019s common stock or trust preferred securities . see also 201csupervision and regulation 201d below . citigroup 2019s capital management framework is designed to ensure that citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with citi 2019s risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines as well as external rating agency considerations . the capital management process is centrally overseen by senior management and is reviewed at the consolidated legal entity and country level . senior management is responsible for the capital management process mainly through citigroup 2019s finance and asset and liability committee finalco with oversight from the risk management and finance committee of citigroup 2019s board of directors . the finalco is composed of the senior-most management of citigroup for the purpose of engaging management in decision-making and related discussions on capital and liquidity matters . among other things finalco 2019s responsibilities include determining the financial structure of citigroup and its principal subsidiaries ensuring that citigroup and its regulated entities are adequately capitalized in consultation with its regulators determining appropriate asset levels and return hurdles for citigroup and individual businesses reviewing the funding and capital markets plan for citigroup and monitoring interest rate risk corporate and bank liquidity and the impact of currency translation on non-u.s . earnings and capital . capital ratios citigroup is subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board . historically capital adequacy has been measured in part based on two risk-based capital ratios the tier 1 capital and total capital tier 1 capital tier 2 capital ratios . tier 1 capital consists of the sum of 201ccore capital elements 201d such as qualifying common stockholders 2019 equity as adjusted qualifying noncontrolling interests and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts principally reduced by goodwill other disallowed intangible assets and disallowed deferred tax assets . total capital also includes 201csupplementary 201d tier 2 capital elements such as qualifying subordinated debt and a limited portion of the allowance for credit losses . both measures of capital adequacy are stated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets . further in conjunction with the conduct of the 2009 supervisory capital assessment program scap u.s . banking regulators developed a new measure of capital termed 201ctier 1 common 201d which has been defined as tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock qualifying noncontrolling interests and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts . citigroup 2019s risk-weighted assets are principally derived from application of the risk-based capital guidelines related to the measurement of credit risk . pursuant to these guidelines on-balance-sheet assets and the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance-sheet exposures such as financial guarantees unfunded lending commitments letters of credit and derivatives are assigned to one of several prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or if relevant the guarantor the nature of the collateral or external credit ratings . risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk on covered trading account positions and all foreign exchange and commodity positions whether or not carried in the trading account . excluded from risk-weighted assets are any assets such as goodwill and deferred tax assets to the extent required to be deducted from regulatory capital . see 201ccomponents of capital under regulatory guidelines 201d below . citigroup is also subject to a leverage ratio requirement a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy which is defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets . to be 201cwell capitalized 201d under federal bank regulatory agency definitions a bank holding company must have a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 6 a total capital ratio of at least 10 10 and a leverage ratio of at least 3 3 and not be subject to a federal reserve board directive to maintain higher capital levels . the following table sets forth citigroup 2019s regulatory capital ratios as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008

incentive plan which authorized the issuance of 12 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options stock appreciation rights unrestricted stock restricted stock units including performance restricted stock and performance units. the 2022 long-term incentive plan replaced the 2015 long-term incentive plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 long-term incentive plan and none of the shares that remain available under the 2015 long-term incentive plan are available for issuance under the 2022 long-term incentive plan. awards under long-term incentive plans may be granted to employees and directors. pursuant to the long-term incentive plan we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return tsr performance restricted stock units eps performance restricted stock units strategic performance restricted stock units time-lapse restricted stock units special performance restricted stock units free cash flow fcf performance restricted stock units and unrestricted stock. under the program awards of tsr performance restricted stock units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period a recipient of tsr performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of eps performance restricted stock units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate goal eps cagr performance restricted stock units measured over a three-year period. a recipient of eps cagr performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of eps performance restricted stock units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. during the three-year vesting period a recipient of eps performance restricted stock units earned a total award of either 0 or 100 of the initial grant. awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics net sales and eps growth compared to strategic plan objectives during a three-year period. a recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of fcf performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. an annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. a recipient of fcf performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 to 200 of the initial grant. awards of time-lapse restricted stock units will vest ratably over the three-year period. in addition we may issue special grants of restricted stock units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. awards are generally granted annually in october. stock options are granted on a selective basis under the long-term incentive plans. the term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. the option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a three-year period. in 2019 we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. we last issued stock options in 2019. in 2024 we issued time-lapse restricted stock units unrestricted stock tsr performance restricted stock units and eps cagr performance restricted stock units. we last issued fcf performance restricted stock units in 2019 eps performance restricted stock units in 2018 strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015. in connection with the sovos brands acquisition we issued 1.721 million time-lapse restricted stock units replacement units in exchange for certain sovos brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. the replacement units are subject to the same terms and conditions of the original sovos brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. certain replacement units were subject to accelerated vesting. the replacement units have a total fair value of 74 million based on the quoted price of our stock on the acquisition date. the portion of replacement units attributed to pre-combination service was 42 million which was accounted for as part of consideration transferred and was recorded in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statements of equity. see note 3 for additional information. the portion of the replacement units attributable to post-combination service will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period. also in connection with the sovos brands acquisition in 2024 our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate goals for the eps cagr performance restricted stock units granted in 2024 2023 and 2022 were revised to equitably adjust for the impact of completed acquisitions and divestitures that were not contemplated at the time of approval of the original targets., humana inc . notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 continued in any spe transactions . the adoption of fin 46 or fin 46-r did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows . in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no . 123r share-based payment or statement 123r which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation . this requirement represents a significant change because fixed-based stock option awards a predominate form of stock compensation for us were not recognized as compensation expense under apb 25 . statement 123r requires the cost of the award as determined on the date of grant at fair value be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period . the grant-date fair value of the award will be estimated using option-pricing models . we are required to adopt statement 123r no later than july 1 2005 under one of three transition methods including a prospective retrospective and combination approach . we previously disclosed on page 67 the effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the black-scholes pricing model for 2004 2003 and 2002 . we currently are evaluating all of the provisions of statement 123r and the expected effect on us including among other items reviewing compensation strategies related to stock-based awards selecting an option pricing model and determining the transition method . in march 2004 the fasb issued eitf issue no . 03-1 or eitf 03-1 the meaning of other-than- temporary impairment and its application to certain investments . eitf 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on certain debt and equity investments when the fair value of the investment security is less than its carrying value . in september 2004 the fasb delayed the previously scheduled third quarter 2004 effective date until the issuance of additional implementation guidance expected in 2005 . upon issuance of a final standard we will evaluate the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations . 3 . acquisitions on february 16 2005 we acquired careplus health plans of florida or careplus as well as its affiliated 10

of keystone on october 12 2007 we held common shares of keystone which were classified as an available-for-sale investment security . accordingly the investment was included in other assets at its

entergy s revenues from its non-utility operations include the sale of electric power and capacity to wholesale customers day-ahead sales of energy in a market administered by an iso operation and management services fees and amortization of a below-market ppa. in 2022 and 2021 the majority of revenues were from the palisades nuclear power plant located in michigan which was shut down in may 2022 and subsequently sold in june 2022. almost all of the palisades nuclear plant output was sold under a 15-year ppa with consumers energy which was executed as part of the acquisition of the plant in 2007 and expired in april 2022. prices under the original ppa ranged from 43.50 mwh in 2007 to 61.50 mwh in 2022 and the average price under the ppa was 51 mwh. entergy executed an additional ppa to cover the period from the expiration of the original ppa through final shutdown in may 2022 at a price of 24.14 mwh. entergy issued monthly invoices to consumers energy for electric sales based on the actual output of electricity and related services provided during the previous month at the contract price. the ppa was at below-market prices at the time of the acquisition and entergy amortized a liability to revenue over the life of the agreement. the amount amortized each period was based upon the present value calculated at the date of acquisition of each year s difference between revenue under the agreement and revenue based on estimated market prices. amounts amortized to revenue were 5 million in 2022 and 12 million in 2021. see note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of

million of fossil plant maintenance and voluntary severance program costs at entergy new orleans as a result of a stipulation approved by the city council . 2003 compared to 2002 net revenue which is entergy s measure of gross margin consists of operating revenues net of 1 fuel fuel-related and purchased power expenses and 2 other regulatory credits . following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2003 to 2002. . in millions 2002 net revenue 4209.6 base rate increases 66.2 base rate decreases -23.3 23.3 deferred fuel cost revisions 56.2 asset retirement obligation 42.9 net wholesale revenue 23.2 march 2002 ark . settlement agreement -154.0 154.0 other -6.3 6.3 2003 net revenue 4214.5 base rates increased net revenue due to base rate increases at entergy mississippi and entergy new orleans that became effective in january 2003 and june 2003 respectively . entergy gulf states implemented base rate decreases in its louisiana jurisdiction effective june 2002 and january 2003 . the january 2003 base rate decrease of 22.1 million had a minimal impact on net income due to a corresponding reduction in nuclear depreciation and decommissioning expenses associated with the change in accounting estimate to reflect an assumed extension of river bend s useful life . the deferred fuel cost revisions variance was due to a revised unbilled sales pricing estimate made in december 2002 and further revision of that estimate in the first quarter of 2003 to more closely align the fuel component of that pricing with expected recoverable fuel costs at entergy louisiana . the asset retirement obligation variance was due to the implementation of sfas 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations adopted in january 2003 . see critical accounting estimates 2013 nuclear decommissioning costs for more details on sfas 143 . the increase was offset by increased depreciation and decommissioning expenses and had an insignificant effect on net income . the increase in net wholesale revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales volume to municipal and cooperative customers . the march 2002 settlement agreement variance reflects the absence in 2003 of the effect of recording the ice storm settlement approved by the apsc in 2002 . this settlement resulted in previously deferred revenues at entergy arkansas per the transition cost account mechanism being recorded in net revenue in the second quarter of 2002 . the decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses and had a minimal effect on net income . gross operating revenues and regulatory credits gross operating revenues include an increase in fuel cost recovery revenues of 682 million and 53 million in electric and gas sales respectively primarily due to higher fuel rates in 2003 resulting from increases in the market prices of purchased power and natural gas . as such this revenue increase was offset by increased fuel and purchased power expenses. .,

by earnings from citi 2019s operating businesses . citi may also augment its capital through issuances of common stock convertible preferred stock preferred stock equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans and in the case of regulatory capital through the issuance of subordinated debt underlying trust preferred securities . in addition the impact of future events on citi 2019s business results such as corporate and asset dispositions as well as changes in accounting standards also affect citi 2019s capital levels . generally capital is used primarily to support assets in citi 2019s businesses and to absorb market credit or operational losses . while capital may be used for other purposes such as to pay dividends or repurchase common stock citi 2019s ability to utilize its capital for these purposes is currently restricted due to its agreements with the u.s . government generally for so long as the u.s . government continues to hold citi 2019s common stock or trust preferred securities . see also 201csupervision and regulation 201d below . citigroup 2019s capital management framework is designed to ensure that citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with citi 2019s risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines as well as external rating agency considerations . the capital management process is centrally overseen by senior management and is reviewed at the consolidated legal entity and country level . senior management is responsible for the capital management process mainly through citigroup 2019s finance and asset and liability committee finalco with oversight from the risk management and finance committee of citigroup 2019s board of directors . the finalco is composed of the senior-most management of citigroup for the purpose of engaging management in decision-making and related discussions on capital and liquidity matters . among other things finalco 2019s responsibilities include determining the financial structure of citigroup and its principal subsidiaries ensuring that citigroup and its regulated entities are adequately capitalized in consultation with its regulators determining appropriate asset levels and return hurdles for citigroup and individual businesses reviewing the funding and capital markets plan for citigroup and monitoring interest rate risk corporate and bank liquidity and the impact of currency translation on non-u.s . earnings and capital . capital ratios citigroup is subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board . historically capital adequacy has been measured in part based on two risk-based capital ratios the tier 1 capital and total capital tier 1 capital tier 2 capital ratios . tier 1 capital consists of the sum of 201ccore capital elements 201d such as qualifying common stockholders 2019 equity as adjusted qualifying noncontrolling interests and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts principally reduced by goodwill other disallowed intangible assets and disallowed deferred tax assets . total capital also includes 201csupplementary 201d tier 2 capital elements such as qualifying subordinated debt and a limited portion of the allowance for credit losses . both measures of capital adequacy are stated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets . further in conjunction with the conduct of the 2009 supervisory capital assessment program scap u.s . banking regulators developed a new measure of capital termed 201ctier 1 common 201d which has been defined as tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock qualifying noncontrolling interests and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts . citigroup 2019s risk-weighted assets are principally derived from application of the risk-based capital guidelines related to the measurement of credit risk . pursuant to these guidelines on-balance-sheet assets and the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance-sheet exposures such as financial guarantees unfunded lending commitments letters of credit and derivatives are assigned to one of several prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or if relevant the guarantor the nature of the collateral or external credit ratings . risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk on covered trading account positions and all foreign exchange and commodity positions whether or not carried in the trading account . excluded from risk-weighted assets are any assets such as goodwill and deferred tax assets to the extent required to be deducted from regulatory capital . see 201ccomponents of capital under regulatory guidelines 201d below . citigroup is also subject to a leverage ratio requirement a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy which is defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets . to be 201cwell capitalized 201d under federal bank regulatory agency definitions a bank holding company must have a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 6 a total capital ratio of at least 10 10 and a leverage ratio of at least 3 3 and not be subject to a federal reserve board directive to maintain higher capital levels . the following table sets forth citigroup 2019s regulatory capital ratios as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 . citigroup regulatory capital ratios . at year end 2009 2008 tier 1 common 9.60 9.60 2.30 2.30 tier 1 capital 11.67 11.92 total capital tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital 15.25 15.70 leverage 6.89 6.08 as noted in the table above citigroup was 201cwell capitalized 201d under the federal bank regulatory agency
