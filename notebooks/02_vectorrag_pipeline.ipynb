    "# VectorRAG Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation defines a modular and extensible VectorRAG system for financial document question answering, supporting evaluation on datasets such as FinQA and FinDER. It is designed to run efficiently on local hardware, including Apple Silicon (M1/M2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 – Chunking\n",
    "`chunker.py` splits each document sample into text and table-based passages using the `chunk_finder_sample()` function. This preserves document structure and prepares it for fine-grained retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 – Embedding\n",
    "`embedder.py` encodes all chunks into vector representations using the `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` model. Batching and MPS acceleration are used for efficient local inference on MacBook hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3 – Indexing\n",
    "The resulting chunk embeddings are indexed using FAISS with L2 similarity (`retriever.py`), allowing fast nearest-neighbor retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4 – Dense Retrieval\n",
    "Given a user query, `embed_query()` embeds it into the same space and retrieves the top-k similar chunks from the FAISS index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5 – Cross-Encoder Reranking (optional)\n",
    "If enabled, `reranker.py` re-scores the top-k retrieved documents using a cross-encoder (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) for improved semantic relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6 – Answer Generation\n",
    "`generator.py` uses the top reranked chunks to construct a prompt for the OpenAI API (or local Fin-R1 model), generating a grounded answer to the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embedding model: `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`\n",
    "- FAISS-based vector retrieval (L2 similarity)\n",
    "- Optional cross-encoder reranking via `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`\n",
    "- Modular architecture for easy experimentation\n",
    "- Optimized for CPU or MPS (Mac) environments"

      "[Text] Loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. These agreements generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses. We typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. Since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan, our aggregate outstanding commitments may significantly exceed our eventual cash outlay.\n",
      "Loan commitments involve credit risk not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We mitigate exposure to credit risk with internal controls that guide how we review and approve applications for credit, establish credit limits and, when necessary, demand collateral. In particular, we evaluate the creditworthiness of each prospective borrower on a case-by-case basis and, when appropriate, adjust the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. Additional information pertaining to this allowance is included in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Liability for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments,” and in Note 5 (“Asset Quality”).\n",
      "We also provide financial support to private equity investments, including existing direct portfolio companies and indirect private equity funds, to satisfy unfunded commitments. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additional information on principal investing commitments is provided in Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”). Other unfunded equity investment commitments at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, related to tax credit investments and were primarily attributable to LIHTC investments. Unfunded tax credit investment commitments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in “other liabilities.” Additional information on LIHTC commitments is provided in Note 13 (“Variable Interest Entities”).\n",

See Note 13: Debt, Note 15: Leases, Note 17: Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, Note 12: Income Taxes, and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 for information about those obligations. Our purchase obligations as of December 31, 2023, were approximately $5,122 million, with approximately $2,702 million expected to be paid in 2024 and $2,420 million thereafter. A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. As of December 31, 2023, future scheduled periodic interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt, including commitment fees that we are obligated to pay on our existing $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility, were approximately $333 million, with approximately $87 million expected to be paid in 2024 and $246 million thereafter.\n",
