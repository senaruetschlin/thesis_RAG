    "        \"We recognize the critical importance of maintaining the safety and security of our systems and data and have a holistic process for overseeing and managing cybersecurity and related risks. This process is supported by both management and our Board of Directors.\\nThe Chief Information Office, which maintains our cybersecurity function, is led by our Chief Information Officer (CIO), who reports to our CEO. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports to the CIO and generally is responsible for management of cybersecurity risk and the protection and defense of our networks and systems. The CISO manages a team of cybersecurity professionals with broad experience and expertise, including in cybersecurity threat assessments and detection, mitigation technologies, cybersecurity training, incident response, cyber forensics, insider threats and regulatory compliance.\\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities in general, and each of our Board committees assists the Board in the role of risk oversight. The full Board receives an update on the Company\\u2019s risk management process and the risk trends related to cybersecurity at least annually. The Audit and Risk Committee specifically assists the Board in its oversight of risks related to cybersecurity. To help ensure effective oversight, the Audit and Risk Committee receives reports on information security and cybersecurity from the CISO at least four times a year.\\nIn addition, the Company\\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management Council (ERMC) considers risks relating to cybersecurity, among other significant risks, and applicable mitigation plans to address such risks. The ERMC is comprised of the Executive Leadership Team, as well as the Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Corporate Secretary, Chief Sustainability Officer, Treasurer and Vice President, Internal Audit. The CIO and CISO attend each ERMC meeting. The ERMC meets during the year and receives periodic updates on cybersecurity risks from the CIO and CISO. We have an established process and playbook led by our CISO governing our assessment, response and notifications internally and externally upon the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident. Depending on the nature and severity of an incident, this process provides for escalating notification to our CEO and the Board (including our Lead Independent Director and the Audit and Risk Committee chair).\\nOur approach to cybersecurity risk management includes the following key elements:\\n\\u2022Multi-Layered Defense and Continuous Monitoring \\u2013 We work to protect our computing environments and products from cybersecurity threats through multi-layered defenses and apply lessons learned from our defense and monitoring efforts to help prevent future attacks. We utilize data analytics to detect anomalies and search for cyber threats. Our Cybersecurity Operations Center provides comprehensive cyber threat detection and response capabilities and maintains a 24x7 monitoring system which complements the technology, processes and threat detection techniques we use to monitor, manage and mitigate cybersecurity threats. From time to time, we engage third party consultants or other advisors to assist in assessing, identifying and\\/or managing cybersecurity threats. We also periodically use our Internal Audit function to conduct additional reviews and assessments.\\n\\u2022Insider Threats \\u2013 We maintain an insider threat program designed to identify, assess, and address potential risks from within our Company. Our program evaluates potential risks consistent with industry practices, customer requirements and applicable law, including privacy and other considerations.\\n\\u2022Information Sharing and Collaboration \\u2013 We work with government, customer, industry and\\/or supplier partners, such as the National Defense Information Sharing and Analysis Center and other government-industry partnerships, to gather and develop best practices and share information to address cyber threats. These relationships enable the rapid sharing of threat and vulnerability mitigation information across the defense industrial base and supply chain.\\n\\u2022Third Party Risk Assessments \\u2013 We conduct information security assessments before sharing or allowing the hosting of sensitive data in computing environments managed by third parties, and our standard terms and conditions contain contractual provisions requiring certain security protections.\\n\\u2022Training and Awareness \\u2013 We provide awareness training to our employees to help identify, avoid and mitigate cybersecurity threats. Our employees with network access participate annually in required training, including spear phishing and other awareness training. We also periodically host tabletop exercises with management and other employees to practice rapid cyber incident response.\\n\\u2022Supplier Engagement \\u2013 We provide training and other resources to our suppliers to support cybersecurity resiliency in our supply chain. We also require our suppliers to comply with our standard information security terms and conditions, in addition to any requirements from our customers, as a condition of doing business with us, and require them to complete information security questionnaires to review and assess any potential cyber-related risks depending on the nature of the services being provided.\\nWhile we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, to date none have materially affected the Company or our financial position, results of operations and\\/or cash flows. We continue to invest in the cybersecurity and resiliency of our networks and to enhance our internal controls and processes, which are designed to help protect our systems and infrastructure, and the information they contain. For more information regarding the risks we face from cybersecurity threats, please see \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d\\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS\\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the information we are incorporating by reference contain statements that constitute \\u201cforward-looking statements\\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \\u201cwill,\\u201d \\u201cexpect,\\u201d \\u201canticipate,\\u201d \\u201cintend,\\u201d \\u201cmay,\\u201d \\u201ccould,\\u201d \\u201cshould,\\u201d \\u201cplan,\\u201d \\u201cproject,\\u201d \\u201cforecast,\\u201d \\u201cbelieve,\\u201d \\u201cestimate,\\u201d \\u201cguidance,\\u201d \\u201coutlook,\\u201d \\u201ctrends,\\u201d \\u201cgoals\\u201d and similar expressions generally identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements relating to our future financial condition, results of operations and\\/or cash flows. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions, expectations, plans and projections that we believe to be reasonable when made, but which may change over time. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and inherently involve a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Specific risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those identified under \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in our other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties are amplified by the global macroeconomic, security and political environments, including inflationary pressures, labor and supply chain challenges, which have caused and will continue to cause significant challenges, instability and uncertainty. They include:\\nIndustry and Economic Risks\\n\\u2022our dependence on the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our business\\n\\u2022significant delays or reductions in appropriations and\\/or for our programs, and U.S. government funding and program support more broadly, including as a result of a prolonged continuing resolution and\\/or government shutdown, and\\/or related to the global security environment or other global events\\n\\u2022significant delays or reductions in payments as a result of or related to a breach of the debt ceiling\\n\\u2022the use of estimates when accounting for our contracts and the effect of contract cost growth and our efforts to recover or offset such costs and\\/or changes in estimated contract costs and revenues, including as a result of inflationary pressures, labor shortages, supply chain challenges and\\/or other macroeconomic factors, and risks related to management\\u2019s judgments and assumptions in estimating and\\/or projecting contract revenue and performance which may be inaccurate\\n\\u2022continued pressures from macroeconomic trends, including on costs, schedules, performance and ability to meet expectations\\n\\u2022increased competition within our markets and bid protests\\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\\n\\u2022investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation (including criminal, civil and administrative) and\\/or other legal proceedings\\n\\u2022the improper conduct of employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures in which we participate, including the impact on our reputation and our ability to do business\\n\\u2022changes in procurement and other laws, SEC, DoD and other rules and regulations, contract terms and practices applicable to our industry, findings by the U.S. government as to our compliance with such requirements, more aggressive enforcement of such requirements and changes in our customers\\u2019 business practices globally\\n\\u2022environmental matters, including climate change, unforeseen environmental costs and government and third party claims\\n\\u2022unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities\\nBusiness and Operational Risks\\n\\u2022cyber and other security threats or disruptions faced by us, our customers or our suppliers and other partners, and changes in related regulations\\n\\u2022our ability to attract and retain a qualified, talented and diverse workforce with the necessary security clearances to meet our performance obligations\\n\\u2022the performance and viability of our subcontractors and suppliers and the availability and pricing of raw materials and components, particularly with inflationary pressures, increased costs, shortages in labor and financial resources, supply chain disruptions, and extended material lead times\\n\\u2022impacts related to health epidemics and pandemics and similar outbreaks\\n\\u2022our exposure to additional risks as a result of our international business, including risks related to global security, geopolitical and economic factors, misconduct, suppliers, laws and regulations\\n\\u2022our ability to innovate, develop new products and technologies, progress and benefit from digital transformation and maintain technologies to meet the needs of our customers\\n\\u2022natural disasters\\n\\u2022products and services we provide related to hazardous and high risk operations, including the production and use of such products, which subject us to various environmental, regulatory, financial, reputational and other risks\\n\\u2022our ability appropriately to exploit and\\/or protect intellectual property rights\\nGeneral and Other Risk Factors\\n\\u2022the adequacy and availability of, and ability to obtain, insurance coverage, customer indemnifications or other liability protections\\n\\u2022the future investment performance of plan assets, gains or losses associated with changes in valuation of marketable securities related to our non-qualified benefit plans, changes in actuarial assumptions associated\\nwith our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and legislative or other regulatory actions impacting our pension and postretirement benefit obligations\\n\\u2022changes in business conditions that could impact business investments and\\/or recorded goodwill or the value of other long-lived assets, and other potential future liabilities\\nWe urge you to consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date this report is first filed or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\"\n",

    "      \"Site leasing revenues\\n\\nRevenue from site leasing is recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five years to fifteen years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue from site leasing represents 93% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. \\n\\nSite development revenues\\n\\nSite development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a fixed price basis that are billed at contractual rates. Revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs incurred. Amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n\\nRevenue from construction projects is recognized over time, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management\\u2019s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. Refer to Note 5 in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for further detail of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.\\n\\nThe site development segment represents approximately 7% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. We account for site development revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Payment terms do not result in any significant financing arrangements. Furthermore, these contracts do not typically include variable consideration; therefore, the transaction price that is recognized over time is generally the amount of the total contract.\\n\\nAccounts receivable\\n\\nThe accounts receivable balance for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $182.7 million and $184.4 million, respectively, of which $32.3 million and $59.6 million related to the site development segment, respectively. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. In addition, we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable. Refer to Note 15 in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment.\"\n",

      "As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 12,400 employees worldwide, of which approximately 12,200 are full-time employees. Approximately 48% of employees are employed within the U.S. and approximately 52% based outside the U.S. Among our U.S. based employees, approximately 15% were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Outside the U.S., we have employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a works council. Our employee base is supplemented by contingent labor where business demand fluctuates or we experience short-term needs for specialized skills. We believe our relations with our workforce in both unionized and non-unionized settings are generally positive.\n",
