0,0,182f0809,"GM operating margin 2023 vs 2022, GM.","To calculate the operating profit margin, we divide Operating Income by Total Net Sales and Revenue. For 2023, the calculation is as follows:

• 2023 Operating Profit Margin = 9,298 / 171,842 ≈ 0.0541, or about 5.41%.

For 2022, using the same method:

• 2022 Operating Profit Margin = 10,315 / 156,735 ≈ 0.0658, or about 6.58%.

This comparison shows that the operating margin declined from approximately 6.58% in 2022 to about 5.41% in 2023.","['CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n \tYears Ended December 31,\n \t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nNet sales and revenue\t\t\t\t\t\nAutomotive\t$\t157,658 \t\t\t$\t143,975 \t\t\t$\t113,590 \t\nGM Financial\t14,184 \t\t\t12,760 \t\t\t13,414 \t\nTotal net sales and revenue (Note 3)\t171,842 \t\t\t156,735 \t\t\t127,004 \t\nCosts and expenses\t\t\t\t\t\nAutomotive and other cost of sales\t141,330 \t\t\t126,892 \t\t\t100,544 \t\nGM Financial interest, operating and other expenses\t11,374 \t\t\t8,862 \t\t\t8,582 \t\nAutomotive and other selling, general and administrative expense\t9,840 \t\t\t10,667 \t\t\t8,554 \t\nTotal costs and expenses\t162,544 \t\t\t146,421 \t\t\t117,680 \t\nOperating income (loss)\t9,298 \t\t\t10,315 \t\t\t9,324 \t\nAutomotive interest expense\t911 \t\t\t987 \t\t\t950 \t\nInterest income and other non-operating income, net (Note 19)\t1,537 \t\t\t1,432 \t\t\t3,041 \t\nEquity income (loss) (Note 8)\t480 \t\t\t837 \t\t\t1,301 \t\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\t10,403 \t\t\t11,597 \t\t\t12,716 \t\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (Note 17)\t563 \t\t\t1,888 \t\t\t2,771 \t\nNet income (loss)\t9,840 \t\t\t9,708 \t\t\t9,945 \t\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\t287 \t\t\t226 \t\t\t74 \t\nNet income (loss) attributable to stockholders\t$\t10,127 \t\t\t$\t9,934 \t\t\t$\t10,019 \t\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\t$\t10,022 \t\t\t$\t8,915 \t\t\t$\t9,837 \t\nEarnings per share (Note 21)\t\t\t\t\t\nBasic earnings per common share\t$\t7.35 \t\t\t$\t6.17 \t\t\t$\t6.78 \t\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – basic\t1,364 \t\t\t1,445 \t\t\t1,451 \t\nDiluted earnings per common share\t$\t7.32 \t\t\t$\t6.13 \t\t\t$\t6.70 \t\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted\t1,369 \t\t\t1,454 \t\t\t1,468']",,Division,FinDER,Arithmetic,"['CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n \tYears Ended December 31,\n \t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nNet sales and revenue\t\t\t\t\t\nAutomotive\t$\t157,658 \t\t\t$\t143,975 \t\t\t$\t113,590 \t\nGM Financial\t14,184 \t\t\t12,760 \t\t\t13,414 \t\nTotal net sales and revenue (Note 3)\t171,842 \t\t\t156,735 \t\t\t127,004 \t\nCosts and expenses\t\t\t\t\t\nAutomotive and other cost of sales\t141,330 \t\t\t126,892 \t\t\t100,544 \t\nGM Financial interest, operating and other expenses\t11,374 \t\t\t8,862 \t\t\t8,582 \t\nAutomotive and other selling, general and administrative expense\t9,840 \t\t\t10,667 \t\t\t8,554 \t\nTotal costs and expenses\t162,544 \t\t\t146,421 \t\t\t117,680 \t\nOperating income (loss)\t9,298 \t\t\t10,315 \t\t\t9,324 \t\nAutomotive interest expense\t911 \t\t\t987 \t\t\t950 \t\nInterest income and other non-operating income, net (Note 19)\t1,537 \t\t\t1,432 \t\t\t3,041 \t\nEquity income (loss) (Note 8)\t480 \t\t\t837 \t\t\t1,301 \t\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\t10,403 \t\t\t11,597 \t\t\t12,716 \t\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (Note 17)\t563 \t\t\t1,888 \t\t\t2,771 \t\nNet income (loss)\t9,840 \t\t\t9,708 \t\t\t9,945 \t\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\t287 \t\t\t226 \t\t\t74 \t\nNet income (loss) attributable to stockholders\t$\t10,127 \t\t\t$\t9,934 \t\t\t$\t10,019 \t\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\t$\t10,022 \t\t\t$\t8,915 \t\t\t$\t9,837 \t\nEarnings per share (Note 21)\t\t\t\t\t\nBasic earnings per common share\t$\t7.35 \t\t\t$\t6.17 \t\t\t$\t6.78 \t\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – basic\t1,364 \t\t\t1,445 \t\t\t1,451 \t\nDiluted earnings per common share\t$\t7.32 \t\t\t$\t6.13 \t\t\t$\t6.70 \t\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted\t1,369 \t\t\t1,454 \t\t\t1,468']",182f0809,True,"['Engineering\n(Dollar amounts in millions)\t\t \t\tVariance\nYear Ended December 31,\t\t2023\t\t2022\t\t2023 vs. 2022\nSales\t\t$\t2,160 \t\t\t$\t2,762 \t\t\t(22)\t%\nOperating profit\t\t$\t491 \t\t\t$\t555 \t\t\t(12)\t%\nAs a percent of sales\t\t22.7 \t%\t\t20.1 \t%\t\t\n \n2023 vs. 2022\n \t\t% Change\nFactors Contributing to Changes - Sales\t\t\nCurrency\t\t1 \t%\nOther\t\t(23)\t%\n(22)\t%\n \nSales\nEngineering segment sales decreased $602 million, or 22%, in 2023 versus 2022 .

1,1,c593f878,"NGC's cyber investments boost investor confidence, enhance valuation, and bolster stability.","The provided information allows us to assess how Northrop Grumman’s investments in cybersecurity can bolster investor confidence and reinforce long-term valuation stability. Specifically, the company’s focus on a multi-layered defense approach, including a dedicated Cybersecurity Operations Center that offers round-the-clock monitoring, continuous threat detection, and rapid incident response, minimizes the risk of cyber breaches. This proactive posture reduces the likelihood of disruptions that might otherwise negatively impact financial performance, cash flows, and overall operational stability.

Additionally, regular third-party assessments further validate the robustness of the company’s cybersecurity measures. These independent reviews help ensure that any vulnerabilities are identified and addressed promptly while reinforcing the credibility of the company’s risk management strategies. The integration of these investments into regular risk oversight through the board, executive risk committees, and specialized groups (like the Audit and Risk Committee) supports transparency and effective governance.

In summary, these cybersecurity investments contribute to investor confidence by mitigating potential risks linked to cyber threats, thereby protecting the company’s financial health and ensuring that valuation remains stable over the long term. While no direct calculations are provided, the qualitative link between enhanced cybersecurity measures and reduced uncertainty around operational and financial risks is evident from the details discussed.","['We recognize the critical importance of maintaining the safety and security of our systems and data and have a holistic process for overseeing and managing cybersecurity and related risks. This process is supported by both management and our Board of Directors.\nThe Chief Information Office, which maintains our cybersecurity function, is led by our Chief Information Officer (CIO), who reports to our CEO. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports to the CIO and generally is responsible for management of cybersecurity risk and the protection and defense of our networks and systems. The CISO manages a team of cybersecurity professionals with broad experience and expertise, including in cybersecurity threat assessments and detection, mitigation technologies, cybersecurity training, incident response, cyber forensics, insider threats and regulatory compliance.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities in general, and each of our Board committees assists the Board in the role of risk oversight. The full Board receives an update on the Company’s risk management process and the risk trends related to cybersecurity at least annually. The Audit and Risk Committee specifically assists the Board in its oversight of risks related to cybersecurity. To help ensure effective oversight, the Audit and Risk Committee receives reports on information security and cybersecurity from the CISO at least four times a year.\nIn addition, the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management Council (ERMC) considers risks relating to cybersecurity, among other significant risks, and applicable mitigation plans to address such risks. The ERMC is comprised of the Executive Leadership Team, as well as the Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Corporate Secretary, Chief Sustainability Officer, Treasurer and Vice President, Internal Audit. The CIO and CISO attend each ERMC meeting. The ERMC meets during the year and receives periodic updates on cybersecurity risks from the CIO and CISO. We have an established process and playbook led by our CISO governing our assessment, response and notifications internally and externally upon the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident. Depending on the nature and severity of an incident, this process provides for escalating notification to our CEO and the Board (including our Lead Independent Director and the Audit and Risk Committee chair).\nOur approach to cybersecurity risk management includes the following key elements:\n•Multi-Layered Defense and Continuous Monitoring – We work to protect our computing environments and products from cybersecurity threats through multi-layered defenses and apply lessons learned from our defense and monitoring efforts to help prevent future attacks. We utilize data analytics to detect anomalies and search for cyber threats. Our Cybersecurity Operations Center provides comprehensive cyber threat detection and response capabilities and maintains a 24x7 monitoring system which complements the technology, processes and threat detection techniques we use to monitor, manage and mitigate cybersecurity threats. From time to time, we engage third party consultants or other advisors to assist in assessing, identifying and/or managing cybersecurity threats. We also periodically use our Internal Audit function to conduct additional reviews and assessments.\n•Insider Threats – We maintain an insider threat program designed to identify, assess, and address potential risks from within our Company. Our program evaluates potential risks consistent with industry practices, customer requirements and applicable law, including privacy and other considerations.\n•Information Sharing and Collaboration – We work with government, customer, industry and/or supplier partners, such as the National Defense Information Sharing and Analysis Center and other government-industry partnerships, to gather and develop best practices and share information to address cyber threats. These relationships enable the rapid sharing of threat and vulnerability mitigation information across the defense industrial base and supply chain.\n•Third Party Risk Assessments – We conduct information security assessments before sharing or allowing the hosting of sensitive data in computing environments managed by third parties, and our standard terms and conditions contain contractual provisions requiring certain security protections.\n•Training and Awareness – We provide awareness training to our employees to help identify, avoid and mitigate cybersecurity threats. Our employees with network access participate annually in required training, including spear phishing and other awareness training. We also periodically host tabletop exercises with management and other employees to practice rapid cyber incident response.\n•Supplier Engagement – We provide training and other resources to our suppliers to support cybersecurity resiliency in our supply chain. We also require our suppliers to comply with our standard information security terms and conditions, in addition to any requirements from our customers, as a condition of doing business with us, and require them to complete information security questionnaires to review and assess any potential cyber-related risks depending on the nature of the services being provided.\nWhile we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, to date none have materially affected the Company or our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

2,2,cb08b8b0,"SBA Comm., credit evals & DTA quality receivables.","The details provided illustrate that SBA Communications Corporation employs a proactive and disciplined approach to managing credit risk associated with its receivables. The company conducts periodic credit evaluations, which means that it regularly reviews the creditworthiness of its customers. This ongoing evaluation helps in identifying any potential deterioration in credit quality early on, thereby allowing the company to adjust its risk management strategy promptly.

In addition, the establishment of an allowance for doubtful accounts is a key risk mitigation tool. By setting aside reserves based on historical experiences, specific customer issues, and past-due balances, the company acknowledges and prepares for the possibility of uncollectible receivables. This practice not only enhances the reliability of its financial statements by reflecting more conservative estimates of collectible revenue but also provides stakeholders with greater assurance that any credit losses are being managed in a structured manner.

Overall, these practices indicate that SBA Communications Corporation has strong internal controls and a robust framework for credit risk management. The systematic credit evaluations combined with the prudent establishment of allowances for doubtful accounts contribute to the overall quality of the company's receivables and help mitigate potential adverse impacts from defaults or delayed collections.","['Site leasing revenues\n\nRevenue from site leasing is recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five years to fifteen years.

However, virtually all DTE Energy's businesses are capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing, as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets. DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors.\nAs part of the normal course of business, DTE Electric, DTE Gas, and various non-utility subsidiaries of DTE Energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal, capacity, storage, and other energy-related products and services. Certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that DTE Energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial. Also, upon a downgrade below investment grade, DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market, and if DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade, the non-utility businesses could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity. A downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets. The impact of a downgrade will not affect DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' ability to comply with existing debt covenants. While DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews."", 'Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources\nCertain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow:  \nDecember 31,\n(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\t2023\t\t2022\nCash and cash equivalents\t$\t2,041 \t\t\t$\t3,581 \t\nAccounts receivable, net(a)\n1,304 \t\t\t1,215 \t\nShort-term borrowings\t3 \t\t\t2 \t\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\t— \t\t\t1,350 \t\nLong-term debt\t6,564 \t\t\t6,552 \t\nWorking capital\t4,454 \t\t\t4,339 \t\nRatio of current assets to current liabilities\t3.36:1\t\t2.37:1\n \n(a)    Accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 45 to 75 days. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding have remained within this range. We regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment.\nFor additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows sections of this MD&A.', 'The Company reviews its trade accounts receivable, related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues for collectability. The Company evaluates the probability of the collection of the lessee’s total accounts receivable, including the corresponding straight-line rent receivable balance on a lease-by-lease basis. The Company’s analysis of its accounts receivable includes (i) customer credit worthiness, (ii) assessment of risk associated with the tenant, and (iii) current economic trends. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. If a lessee’s accounts receivable balance is considered uncollectible, the Company will write-off the uncollectible receivable balances associated with the lease and will only recognize lease income on a cash basis. The Company includes provision for doubtful accounts in Revenues from rental properties, net, in accordance with Topic 842. Lease income will then be limited to the lesser of (i) the straight-line rental income or (ii) the lease payments that have been collected from the lessee. In addition to the lease-specific collectability assessment performed under Topic 842, the analysis also recognizes a general reserve under ASC Topic 450 Contingencies, as a reduction to Revenues from rental properties, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the Company’s historical and current collection experience and the potential for settlement of arrears. Although the Company estimates uncollectible receivables and provides for them through charges against revenues from rental properties, actual results may differ from those estimates. If the Company subsequently determines that it is probable it will collect the remaining lessee’s lease payments under the lease term, the Company will then reinstate the straight-line balance.', 'Sales of Financing Receivables\n\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, $1.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.', 'Sales are typically made on credit, and we generally do not require collateral. We are exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. Our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable,notes receivable, and contract assets is developed using historical collection experience, published or estimated credit default rates for entities that represent our customer base, current and future economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of customers’ trade accounts receivables. We review receivables for U.S. and international customers separately to better reflect different published credit default rates and economic and market conditions. Additionally, specific reserve amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. Our monitoring activities include account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of customers’ financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.', 'The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition to manage collection risk, in some cases supplemented by collateral. The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses, and such losses have historically been within management’s expectations.

We make estimates of expected allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, changes to customer creditworthiness, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers.\n\nUnbilled receivables – Our unbilled receivables include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under software milestone billings associated with multi-year term license renewals and software implementations when the input method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not solely due to the passage of time.

We are a large owner, operator and developer of towers, with substantial capital, human, and operating resources. We have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the U.S. since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997. We believe our size, experience, capabilities, and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the U.S. and internationally. Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development, with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries. We believe that our industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will permit us to continue to organically grow our site leasing and site development services.\n\nSystematic Tower Portfolio Growth. We intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures. We believe that one of the best uses of our liquidity, including cash from operating activities and borrowings, is to acquire and/or build new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios.', 'Our industry is highly competitive. We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation, Telesites S.A.B. de C.V. and Cellnex Telecom, S.A., wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers Limited and private tower companies, private equity sponsored firms, carrier-affiliated tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. Our data center business also competes with a variety of companies offering similar data center solutions and services, including space, power, interconnection and development services. We believe that location and capacity, grid distribution constraints, network and/or interconnection density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites and data center facilities.']",1357.1442499523982,89200

In 2022 and 2021, the majority of revenues were from the Palisades nuclear power plant located in Michigan, which was shut down in May 2022 and subsequently sold in June 2022. Almost all of the Palisades nuclear plant output was sold under a 15-year PPA with Consumers Energy, which was executed as part of the acquisition of the plant in 2007 and expired in April 2022. Prices under the original PPA ranged from $43.50/MWh in 2007 to $61.50/MWh in 2022, and the average price under the PPA was $51/MWh. Entergy executed an additional PPA to cover the period from the expiration of the original PPA through final shutdown in May 2022 at a price of $24.14/MWh. Entergy issued monthly invoices to Consumers Energy for electric sales based on the actual output of electricity and related services provided during the previous month at the contract price.  The PPA was at below-market prices at the time of the acquisition and Entergy amortized a liability to revenue over the life of the agreement.  The amount amortized each period was based upon the present value, calculated at the date of acquisition, of each year’s difference between revenue under the agreement and revenue based on estimated market prices.

8,8,9c01e59c,Competitor mix impact on pricing & positioning for NRG Energy (NRG).,"The provided data gives insight into the diverse competitive landscape that NRG Energy faces, and from that, we can infer several impacts on its competitive positioning and pricing strategy. Specifically:

1. Fragmented Market Dynamics: With competitors ranging from regulated utilities to independent power producers and various electric retailers outside of Texas, NRG Energy operates in a market that is highly fragmented. This variation means that different regions will have different levels of competition, regulatory oversight, and customer expectations. In deregulated markets, such as Texas, customers can easily switch providers based on pricing and value propositions. Outside of Texas, where incumbents like regulated utilities and a mix of independent providers are more dominant, NRG may have less flexibility to aggressively undercut prices, as incumbents might have regulatory advantages or established customer bases.

2. Competitive Pricing Pressure: In competitive markets where customers have many choices—including those offered by independent power producers and other retailers—NRG is compelled to adopt a pricing strategy that is both competitive and reflective of local market conditions. The need to appeal to both price-sensitive and value-driven customers forces NRG to carefully balance its pricing, ensuring it remains attractive in a market with several alternative options. In regions with regulated utilities, the rates can sometimes be more stable due to regulatory frameworks, which may limit pricing flexibility and require NRG to find other ways (e.g., service differentiation) to compete.

3. Differentiation Strategy: The data suggests that even though competition is broad and varied, many competitors do not provide comprehensive solutions or differentiated services. For NRG Energy, this competitive mix creates both a challenge and an opportunity. While the presence of regulated utilities and independent power producers means a strong baseline of competition, it also offers NRG an opportunity to differentiate itself—potentially through integrated service offerings, innovative pricing models, or tailored energy solutions that provide added value beyond basic electricity supply.

4. Regulatory and Market Specificities: The competitive landscape changes drastically from one region to another. In markets where regulatory utilities dominate, pricing might be less about aggressive cost-cutting and more about aligning with regulated rate structures, whereas in more liberal deregulated environments, competitive pricing and frequent promotions may be expected. This forces NRG to adopt a localized pricing strategy that accounts for the strengths and competitive tactics of local incumbents and emerging independent providers.

In summary, the mix of competitors impacts NRG Energy's competitive positioning by pushing it to not only compete on price in highly competitive, deregulated environments but also to differentiate its offerings in regions where it competes against established, regulated players. This dual challenge influences its overall pricing strategy, leading the company to strategically tailor its approaches by market, balancing competitive pricing with value-driven service innovation to maintain its position.","['While there has been consolidation in the competitive retail energy space over the past few years, there is still considerable competition for customers at NRG. In Texas, there is healthy competition in deregulated areas and customers can choose providers based on the most appealing offers. Outside of Texas, electricity retailers compete with the incumbent utilities, in addition to other retail electric providers, which can inhibit competition depending on the market rules of the state.

The effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted.\nPrice, contract terms, availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service, including infrastructure availability and distribution efficiencies affect competition. We believe that our concentrated acreage positions and our access to both third-party and Company-owned gathering and pipeline infrastructure in our core operating areas, along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years, enhance our competitive position.', 'We are one of the world’s largest diversified energy services companies. Our services and products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services and products include: price; service delivery; health, safety, and environmental standards and practices; service quality; global talent retention; understanding the geological characteristics of the reservoir; product quality; warranty; and technical proficiency.', 'Competition in the markets in which we operate is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, subsidies provided by state and federal governments for new and existing generation facilities, including renewables generation and battery ESS, new market entrants, construction of new generation assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities, and other factors. We primarily compete with other electricity generators and retailers based on our ability to generate electric supply, market and sell electricity at competitive prices and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities to deliver electricity to end-users. Competitors in the generation and retail power markets in which we participate include numerous regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities, independent power producers, REPs and other energy marketers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information concerning the risks faced with respect to the markets in which we operate.', 'Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. We also compete for the equipment, services and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties, such as drilling rigs and oilfield services. The rising costs and scarcity caused by this competitive pressure will generally increase during periods of higher commodity prices and can be further exacerbated by higher inflation rates and supply chain disruptions in the broader economy. For example, we experienced higher operating costs throughout 2023 due to steep cost inflation, and these inflationary pressures could continue in 2024. Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Certain of our competitors have resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic long-term positions and relationships. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as changing worldwide price and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulations.', 'We compete for natural gas, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil volumes with other midstream companies, major integrated oil companies and independent exploration and production companies that have gathering and processing assets, fractionators, pipelines, terminals and storage facilities.

Electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water heating, and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved equipment efficiencies, and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential, commercial, and industrial markets.\nOur pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage, and other services for customers.

Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants and renewables such as wind and solar have also caused, and could continue to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. In addition, the introduction of low-cost disruptive technologies or the entry of non-traditional competitors into our sector and markets could adversely affect our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.']",930.519957910292,"NRG’s rivals range from regulated utilities and large independent power producers in power markets to integrated oil-and-gas majors, midstream pipeline operators and energy marketers; this diverse, well-capitalized mix exerts constant downward pressure on wholesale and retail power prices and raises input-cost volatility.

10,10,800ca373,AEP's EPS FY23 recon check: basic EPS vs net inc.,"For FY2023, American Electric Power Company reports net income attributable to AEP common shareholders of $2,208.1 million, with a weighted average of 518,903,682 basic shares outstanding and a basic earnings per share (EPS) of $4.26. Conceptually, if you multiply the EPS by the number of shares, you should obtain the net income figure. As a simple check:

 EPS × Shares = $4.26 × 518,903,682 ≈ $2,208.1 million

This multiplication confirms that the EPS figure is consistent with the total net income reported. Such an addition-based (or aggregation-based) check supports the accuracy of the EPS calculation because it demonstrates that, on a per-share basis, the net income has been correctly allocated across the number of outstanding shares. If the multiplication did not reconcile with the reported earnings, it would suggest a miscalculation or inconsistency in either the EPS or the share count, thereby raising questions about the reliability of the reported performance.","['AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY, INC.

12,12,5dbcd4b2,Feb 23 signature date for Wynn governance board continuity.,"The uniform signature date of February 23, 2024, indicates that all key signatories—ranging from the CEO to board directors—executed the document on the same day. This is significant in corporate governance as it confirms that on that date, the board and top management collectively endorsed the document, thereby establishing a single point in time when the decisions, policies, or updates reflected in the document became effective. Such synchronization helps ensure operational continuity by:

• Reinforcing the integrity and timing of the board's decisions—since all signatures confirm the board’s unified approval, it minimizes ambiguity about when the actions were officially adopted.

• Supporting transparency and accountability—stakeholders can clearly trace when the document was executed, which is a key aspect of sound governance.

• Indicating coordinated execution of corporate actions—this can be critical during periods of transition or strategic initiatives, ensuring that all directors and executive officers are aligned on the same timeline for the implementation of policies and decisions.

Ultimately, the single dated signature underscores the board’s unified commitment and reduces the risk of disputes regarding the timing or effectiveness of the board’s resolutions, thereby bolstering both internal governance standards and external investor confidence.","['Signature\t\tTitle\t\tDate\n/s/ Craig S.

13,13,1672b3e6,"Marsh & McLennan's cybersecurity risk mitigation framework outlines the fin. impacts associated with its strategies, specifically for ticker.","Marsh & McLennan Companies’ cybersecurity risk management framework is designed to reduce the financial impact of cyber incidents and support long-term financial health through a multi-layered approach. First, the framework includes rigorous third-party vendor assessments and contractual protections that ensure external service providers adhere to high cybersecurity standards. This minimizes the risk that vendors introduce vulnerabilities that could lead to costly breaches. The contractual provisions often include risk transfer mechanisms such as liability clauses, which help contain potential losses if a breach is linked to a vendor’s system.

In addition, the company employs technical controls (like multifactor authentication and secured network access via VPNs or private channels) and a well-documented incident response plan. This preparedness reduces the likelihood that an incident escalates into a significant disruption, thereby avoiding direct costs related to remediation, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. The ongoing monitoring and periodic third-party penetration testing further ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed early.

Furthermore, the integration of multiple departments (risk management, legal, compliance, IT, etc.) in managing cybersecurity risks allows the company to allocate resources efficiently, prioritize risk mitigation, and maintain robust oversight. This continuous monitoring, combined with regular updates to the Board and Audit Committee, ensures that any emerging cyber threats are quickly identified and mitigated before they can materially affect the company’s strategic or operational performance.

In summary, by proactively mitigating cybersecurity risks through comprehensive vendor assessments, contractual safeguards, and embedded technical controls, Marsh & McLennan Companies minimizes the chances of a costly cyber incident. This not only protects the company from immediate financial losses but also supports long-term financial stability by maintaining market confidence and preventing potential disruptions to its business operations.","['As a professional services firm that processes confidential and sensitive information, such as personal information, cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our enterprise risk management strategy at Marsh & McLennan.

16,16,f11f79ac,"Darden Restaurants FY24 new hire ratio & workforce trends, DRI.","Calculation: The percentage of current hourly employees who were new hires in fiscal 2024 is calculated as (137,038 new hires / 180,207 current hourly employees) × 100 ≈ 76%. This high percentage suggests that a large portion of the hourly workforce was brought on during fiscal 2024. Two potential inferences can be drawn from this ratio: (1) The company might be experiencing rapid workforce growth, indicating expansion and an increasing scale of operations; or (2) The high percentage of new hires could also be a result of significant turnover, where many positions were vacated and subsequently refilled. Without additional data on separation rates or details about whether the expansion is strategic (i.e., net growth) or compensatory (i.e., replacing departing employees), it is unclear which factor is most pronounced. However, the data clearly indicate noteworthy changes in the composition of the workforce during the period.","['Hire.

17,17,d15dde9e,"Impact of F5 litigation def on cap alloc & growth, ticker at end.","The litigation, though being vigorously defended and not triggering any loss contingencies on the balance sheet, still carries the risk of unforeseen future liabilities that could impact capital allocation decisions and long-term growth. First, the Company’s strategy of defending disputes aggressively may help preserve its reputation and intellectual property rights, but if an adverse outcome is eventually realized, it could force a reallocation of capital towards settlements or legal expenses rather than investments in growth initiatives. Without recording loss contingencies, there is a risk that sudden, significant cash outflows (if litigation results in unfavorable judgments or settlements) might strain liquidity. This uncertainty can lead to a more conservative stance from management in capital budgeting, potentially causing delays or cuts in research and development, acquisitions, or other strategic investments. Furthermore, the uncertainty around potential litigation costs can also affect its cost of capital if investors demand a higher return for perceived legal risk. In summary, while the current approach may reflect confidence in the legal defense, the unresolved disputes add a layer of unpredictability that could lead to re-prioritizing cash flows toward mitigating legal risks rather than fueling long-term operational and strategic growth.","[""Lynwood Investment CY Limited v.

In its complaint, Lynwood claims to be the assignee of all rights and interests of Rambler Internet Holding LLC (“Rambler”), and alleges that the intellectual property in the NGINX software originally released by the co-founder of NGINX in 2004 belongs to Rambler (and therefore Lynwood, by assignment) because the software was created and developed while the co-founder was employed by Rambler. Lynwood asserted 26 causes of action against the various defendants, including copyright infringement, violation of trademark law, tortious interference, conspiracy, and fraud.

In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\nIn April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. In addition, in September 2023 the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us based on its finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We have appealed the EC’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings.\nIn a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately €593 million in default interest on the original €1.1 billion fine that was held by the EC for 12 years, which applications have been stayed pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision.\nLitigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities\nIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies\u202fthat it had identified security vulnerabilities, the first variants of which are now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.\nAs of January 24, 2024, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of this class of security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018, and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs appealed, and in November 2023 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s judgment. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case relating to Spectre and Meltdown pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint relating to Spectre and Meltdown in June 2022. The Argentinian court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing in May 2023, and plaintiffs have appealed. In November 2023, new plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to a further vulnerability variant disclosed in August 2023 and commonly referred to as “Downfall.” We moved to dismiss that complaint in January 2024. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.\nLitigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement\nMultiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain officers following our July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in April 2023 entered judgment. Plaintiffs have appealed. Given the procedural posture and the nature of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, we introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4.\nLitigation Related to Patent and IP Claims\nWe have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel\nIn October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI granted Intel a covenant not to sue on the two patents the court said can proceed to trial as it appeals losses it suffered earlier in the case on three other patents. VLSI has requested that the judge take the trial scheduled for March 2024 off calendar. In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP:"", 'Securities Litigation\n\nCity of Warren v.

18,18,c808ac7f,$384M op lease cash flow flex from Applied Materials.,"The operating lease obligations of $384 million, with $96 million due in the next 12 months, suggest a fixed, recurring cash outflow that will affect short-term liquidity. Specifically, the $96 million payment required within one year means that the company must allocate a significant portion of its near-term cash flow to meet these lease commitments. This can constrain the availability of cash for discretionary spending, debt repayment, or strategic investment, particularly if operating cash flows were to weaken. On the other hand, since operating lease payments are generally fixed and predictable, they provide transparency in budgeting, even if they reduce overall financial flexibility. In assessing overall financial flexibility, it is important to compare these lease obligations with other current liabilities and the company’s ability to generate consistent operating cash flow. While the lease payments do require disciplined cash management, they are less flexible than debt obligations and can represent a potential risk if an adverse economic environment were to impair cash flow generation. Ultimately, the near-term $96 million outlay might impose a temporary strain on cash flow stability, but if managed within the context of strong operating cash flows, the company can maintain overall financial resilience.","['We at Applied Materials have certain on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet obligation arrangements to make future payments under various contracts.

IPS operating profit declined 140 basis points due to an unfavorable acquisition impact and severance costs.

20,20,3fae1303,"Share repurchase history of MLM, focusing on capital allocation strategy.","The data provided outlines a historical series of share repurchase authorizations and reveals how Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. has used share buybacks as a key tool in its capital allocation strategy. In particular:

1. **Consistent Return of Capital**: The fact that the company has periodically announced repurchase programs—as early as 1994 with 2.5 million shares and successive approvals in 2006, 2007, and 2015—demonstrates a long-term strategy to return excess cash to shareholders rather than investing all of it in operational growth. This reflects a deliberate capital allocation choice aimed at boosting shareholder value when internal projects or external acquisitions may not be as attractive.

2. **Increasing Magnitude of Repurchases**: The current authorization of up to 20 million shares indicates a significant scale-up compared to earlier programs. This change may signal that management has grown more confident in the company’s financial position and its future cash flows. It also suggests that they see the prevailing market conditions as favorable for repurchases, potentially believing that the shares are undervalued.

3. **Capital Structure Optimization**: Regular share repurchase programs can help improve metrics like earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of outstanding shares. The evolution and expansion of these programs over time imply that management is actively managing the capital structure to enhance shareholder return and maintain flexibility, especially when faced with variable business cycles.

4. **Market Signaling**: By updating the repurchase authorization periodically and disclosing details in press releases, the company sends a signal to the market about its confidence in future performance. The progressive increase in the allowable repurchase volume aligns with a strategy of seizing opportunities to offset dilution from capital raising or simply leveraging stock buyback benefits during periods of strong cash flow.

In summary, the historical and current details of share repurchase programs reflect a well-calibrated capital allocation strategy in which Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. balances reinvestment with returning capital to shareholders. The evolution in the size of the programs over time signals enhanced financial strength and a proactive approach to optimizing shareholder value.","['Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\n \n\nPeriod\n\n \n\nTotal\nNumber of\nShares\nPurchased\n\n \n\n \n\nAverage\nPrice Paid\nper Share\n\n \n\n \n\nTotal\nNumber of\nShares\nPurchased\nas Part of\nPublicly\nAnnounced\nPlans or\nPrograms(1)\n\n \n\n \n\nMaximum\nNumber of\nShares that\nMay Yet be\nPurchased\nUnder the\nPlans or\nPrograms\n\n \n\nOctober 1, 2023 — October 31, 2023\n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12,721,096\n\n \n\nNovember 1, 2023 — November 30, 2023\n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12,721,096\n\n \n\nDecember 1, 2023 — December 31, 2023\n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12,721,096\n\n \n\nTotal\n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12,721,096\n\n \n\n1.\nThe Company’s stock repurchase program, which currently authorizes the repurchase of 20 million shares of common stock, is approved by the Board of Directors from time to time, and updated as appropriate by the Board of Directors, and announced to the public by press release.

Since fiscal 2013, we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program.  Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from non-recourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.\nOur current capital allocation strategy is to focus on our core business. Given our recent performance and continued market uncertainties, we are taking a conservative approach to our capital structure in order to maintain the flexibility that allows us to efficiently access the capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole. We have taken steps to better align our expenses to sales as well as slowed the rate of our store growth. We resumed our share repurchases during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 after a pause initiated during the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, we intend to modestly accelerate the pace of our share repurchases above the pace that we implemented in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. We believe we have the appropriate liquidity, access to capital and financial strength to support our operations and continue investing in our strategic initiatives for the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, purchase obligations and commitments, income taxes and defined benefit retirement plans. See Notes 12 and 16 for amounts outstanding as of February 29, 2024 related to debt and leases, respectively.\nOur contractual obligations related to income taxes represent the net unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. See Note 10 for information related to income taxes. Our contractual obligations related to defined benefit retirement plans represent the funded status recognized as of February 29, 2024. See Note 11 for information related to these plans.\nPurchase obligations and commitments consist of certain enforceable and legally binding obligations related to real estate purchases, third-party outsourcing services and advertising. As of February 29, 2024, our purchase obligations and commitments were approximately $428.2 million, of which $213.3 million are due in fiscal 2025. The majority of the remaining purchase obligations and commitments are due within the next three years.\nWe have historically managed leverage based on a number of factors, including internal financial forecasts, consideration of CAF’s operational and capital needs, external peer benchmarking, requirements of our debt agreements and macroeconomic conditions. Generally, we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources, together with stock repurchases, to maintain a leverage profile that ensures operating flexibility while supporting continued investment in the business.', 'Overview of Capital Structure\nHistorically, we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations, the issuance of notes in the financial markets, bank borrowings and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies. Our capital allocation strategy includes reinvesting in our business, maintaining an investment grade credit rating, maintaining a relevant dividend and deploying excess free cash flow to share repurchases or acquisitions.\nWe had cash and cash investments of approximately $634 million and $452 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts, time deposit accounts, and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. While we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments. Of the cash and cash investments we held at December 31, 2023 and 2022, $323 million and $321 million, respectively, was held in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., their repatriation into the U.S. would not result in significant additional U.S. income tax or foreign withholding tax, as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted.\nOur current ratio was 1.7 to 1 and 1.6 to 1 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in our current ratio is primarily due to the repayment of the 364-day term loan during 2023.\nOur total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 97 percent and 109 percent at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Refer to Note K to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations, and borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment needs. We believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities. However, due to the changing market conditions and its impact on our customers and suppliers, we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact that the changing market conditions may have on our future financial condition.', ""The Company believes it has a strong track record of deploying capital to investments that enhance the Company's business and return capital to shareholders.\nDuring 2023, the Company invested $671.5 million in strategic business acquisitions. The acquisitions have enhanced the Company’s service offerings, expanded its customer and revenue mix, and strengthened and broadened the scope of its geographic presence. The Company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities that leverage the Company’s core competencies, complement existing scientific and technological capabilities, increase the Company’s presence in key geographic, therapeutic and strategic areas, and meet or exceed the Company’s financial criteria.\nDuring 2023, the Company repurchased 4.8 million shares of Common Stock at an average price of $206.85 per share for a total cost of $1,000.0 million. The Company has accrued $9.0 million of excise tax related to this accelerated share repurchase, which will be paid in April 2024. At the end of 2023, the Company had outstanding authorization from the Board to purchase $530.4 million of Common Stock.\nDuring 2023, capital expenditures were $453.6 million. The Company expects capital expenditures in 2024 to be approximately 3.5% of revenues, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the Company's core businesses, facility expansion and updates, projects related to its LaunchPad initiative, and further acquisition integration initiatives."", 'Our Board of Directors has approved the following authorization to repurchase common stock: March 2014 authorization program for 300 million shares, with 144 million outstanding at December 31, 2023. To implement this authorization, we have used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We have also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. We will continue to fund any share repurchases through a combination of cash from operations, borrowings dependent on market conditions, or cash from the disposition of certain non-strategic investments.\n\nOur 2024 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt and asset sales.

As of December 31, 2023, $6.9 billion remains authorized by our Board of Directors for repurchase.

At December 31, 2023, $1.0 billion of share repurchases were available under the program. Repurchases under the program may be effected from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2024. The timing and amount of the repurchase transactions under this program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, the development of the economy, corporate and regulatory considerations. We will continue to monitor our share price and, depending upon results of operations, market conditions and the development of the economy, as well as other factors, we will consider share repurchases on an opportunistic basis.', 'The company repurchased $14.9 billion of its common stock in 2023 under its stock repurchase program.', 'Globe Life has an ongoing share repurchase program that began in 1986. The share repurchase program is reviewed with the Board of Directors by management quarterly, and continues indefinitely unless and until the Board of Directors decides to suspend, terminate or modify the program.

The specific timing and amount of any share repurchases, and the specific timing and amount of any dividend payments, under the 2023-2024 Stockholder Return Program will depend on prevailing share prices, general economic and market conditions, Company performance, and other considerations.

The pillars of our strategy to achieve this objective and elevate our growth profile include:\n•Geographically diverse portfolio of hotels in the U.S. - Own a diversified portfolio of hotels in the U.S. in major urban and resort destinations. Target markets with diverse demand generators, high barriers to entry, favorable supply and demand dynamics and attractive long-term projected RevPAR growth;•Strong scale and integrated platform - Utilize our scale to create value through enterprise analytics, asset management and capital investment initiatives, while aiding external growth by leveraging scale as a competitive advantage to acquire assets befitting our strategy. Allocate and recycle capital to seek returns that exceed our cost of capital and actively return capital to stockholders;\n•Investment grade balance sheet - Maintain a strong and flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout all phases of the lodging cycle; and\n•Employer of choice and responsible corporate citizen - Align our organizational structure with our business objectives to be an employer of choice and a responsible corporate citizen.\nGeographically Diverse Portfolio\nWe seek to have a geographically diversified portfolio in major markets and premier resort destinations in the U.S. We primarily focus on acquisitions and, occasionally, new development opportunities to enhance our portfolio. While we have historically targeted acquisitions in the top 25 U.S. markets, we also consider hotels in other markets, which we believe have high growth potential and diverse demand generators. We focus generally on the following types of assets:\n•Resorts in destination locations with limited supply growth. These assets feature superior amenities and unique experiential offerings;\n•Convention destination hotels that are group oriented in urban and resort markets. These assets feature extensive and high-quality meeting facilities and often are connected to prominent convention centers; and\n•High-end urban hotels that are positioned in prime locations and possess multiple demand drivers for both business and leisure travelers.\nAs one of the largest owners of Marriott and Hyatt hotels, our hotels primarily are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Within these brands, we have focused predominantly on the upper-upscale and luxury chain scales, as we believe these have a broad appeal for both individual and group leisure and business customers. In addition, we own several unbranded or soft-branded hotels that appeal to distinctive customer profiles in certain submarkets.Strong Scale and Integrated Platform\nEnterprise Analytics Platform. Due to the scale of our asset management and business intelligence platform, we believe we are in a unique position to implement value-added real estate decisions and to assist our managers in improving operating performance and profitability. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading brands and operators in the industry allow our enterprise analytics team to benchmark similar hotels and identify revenue-enhancement opportunities and cost efficiencies that can maximize the operating performance, long-term profitability and value of our real estate. We perform independent underwriting of return on investment (“ROI”) projects and potential acquisitions, as well as revenue management analysis of ancillary revenue opportunities. Our goal is to continue to differentiate our hotels within their competitive markets, drive operating performance and enhance the overall value of our real estate through the following:\n•Enhance operating performance and profitability by using our business intelligence system to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls.\n•Drive revenue growth by conducting detailed strategic reviews with our managers on markets and business mix to assist them in developing the appropriate group/transient mix, online presence to address a broad customer base, and market share targets for each hotel.\n•Work with leading brands, such as Marriott and Hyatt, to take advantage of their worldwide presence and lodging infrastructure. We also have a selection of hotels managed by independent operators where we believe these operators have more flexibility to drive revenues and control costs to maximize profits.•Improve asset value through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements to increase contract flexibility.\nDisciplined Capital Allocation. Guided by a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are equipped to make investment decisions that seek to deliver the greatest value and returns to stockholders. Our goal is to allocate capital to enhance and improve our portfolio, while balancing the importance of prudently returning capital to stockholders.\nFor 2024, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation and intend to take advantage of our strong balance sheet and overall scale. We are constantly evaluating potential acquisitions of iconic upper-upscale and luxury properties that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages. Similarly, we intend to continue our capital recycling program with strategic and opportunistic dispositions. This may include the sale of assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or hotels with significant capital expenditure requirements that we do not believe would generate an adequate return.\nWe may acquire additional properties or dispose of properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders. We anticipate that any acquisitions may be funded by, or through a combination of, proceeds from the sales of hotels, equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., incurrence of debt, available cash or advances under our credit facility. We note, however, that the nature and supply of these assets make acquisitions inherently difficult to predict. For these reasons, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in purchasing any one or more hotels that we are reviewing currently, or may in the future review, bid on or negotiate to buy.\nWe also seek to create and mine value from our existing portfolio through value enhancement initiatives and ROI projects. We believe these investments provide a significant opportunity to achieve returns well in excess of our cost of capital. We work closely with our managers to attempt to schedule these projects to minimize operational disruption and environmental impact. Value enhancement initiatives seek to maximize the value of real estate within our existing portfolio through its highest and best use. These projects may include hotel expansion, timeshare, office space or condominium units on excess land, redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space, and the acquisition of development entitlements. ROI projects are designed to improve the positioning of our hotels within their markets and competitive set. These projects include extensive renovations, including guest rooms, lobbies, food and beverage outlets; expansions and/or extensive renovation of ballroom and meeting rooms; major mechanical system upgrades; and green building initiatives and certifications. Also included are projects focused on increasing space profitability or lowering net operating costs, such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space, adding guestrooms, and implementing energy and water conservation measures such as LED lighting, high-efficiency mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment and fixtures, solar power, energy management systems, guestroom water efficient fixtures, and building automation systems.\nRenewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels. Typically, renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven to ten years, but the timing may vary based on the type of property, function of area being renovated, hotel occupancy and other factors. These renovations generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, case goods, bathroom and architectural and engineering systems. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, textiles and wall finishes, which may require more frequent updates to maintain brand quality standards. Case goods include dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and meeting room tables and chairs, which generally are not replaced as frequently.

The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were $97.9 billion, of which we expect to recognize approximately 39% as revenues over the next twelve months, 36% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, 19% over the subsequent month 37 to month 60 and the remainder thereafter.\n\nSales of Financing Receivables', 'Balance at December 31, 2021\n\n\n$\n\n272\n\n\n$\n\n38\n\nIncrease (decrease)\n\n44\n\n(26)\n\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n\n316\n\n12\n\nIncrease (decrease)\n\n21\n\n(2)\n\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n\n\n$\n\n337\n\n\n$\n\n10\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, contract liabilities increased by $19 million, which is net of cash received of $984 million and amounts recognized as sales of $965 million, the majority of which related to current contract liabilities. The amount of sales recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023, that was included in the company’s opening contract liabilities balance was $316 million, all of which related to current contract liabilities. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the company’s contract liabilities primarily results from timing differences between the company’s performance and the customer’s payments. Current contract liabilities are classified within other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and noncurrent contract liabilities are classified within other liabilities.\n\n\nThe company also recognized additional sales of $20 million and $8 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods.

23,23,ce3dbb01,Brown & Brown's structured IR protocols affect liability cost impact.,"The company’s proactive incident response and prevention protocols, such as the structured use of internal and external scans along with third-party penetration tests, play a critical role in reducing potential liability and associated costs in several ways:

1. Early Detection & Mitigation: Regular internal persistent scans, monthly external scans, and periodic third-party penetration tests enable the company to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Early detection minimizes the likelihood of a successful breach, reducing the severity of any potential incident and the costs associated with remediation.

2. Reduced Remediation Costs: By identifying security weaknesses early, the company can address issues promptly. This proactive approach can lower the expenses required for incident response, forensic analysis, and remediation compared to the higher costs incurred after a major breach.

3. Demonstration of Due Diligence: These robust protocols reflect the company’s commitment to cybersecurity best practices. In the event of an incident, documented evidence of proactive risk management and compliance (including adherence to standards such as SOC 2 Type II) can help mitigate regulatory penalties and legal liabilities by showing that the company took reasonable measures to protect sensitive information.

4. Enhanced Insurance Coverage Benefits: The company’s use of these protocols supports its cyber liability insurance by potentially lowering risk exposure. In the event of a breach, having well-documented security practices can facilitate more favorable terms from insurers or help in reducing claim amounts.

5. Minimization of Operational Disruption: A well-structured incident response process — integrating immediate action from specialized teams and clear communication protocols — helps minimize downtime. Reduced operational disruption directly translates into lower indirect costs and helps maintain customer confidence and revenue integrity.

Overall, by investing in continuous vulnerability assessments and structured incident response, the company not only shields itself from the direct financial and reputational impacts of a cybersecurity incident but also positions itself better in terms of regulatory compliance and risk management, thereby reducing the potential liability and costs associated with data breaches.","['The Company relies on our internal Technology Solutions team and third-party vendors to provide effective and efficient service to our customers, process claims and timely and accurately report information to carriers, which often involves secure processing of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information.

Because legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters. We record a liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Based on the opinion of management, we do not expect the ultimate outcome of currently pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters.\nOn July 31, 2018, International Engineering & Construction S.A. (""IEC"") initiated arbitration proceedings in New York administered by the International Center for Dispute Resolution (""ICDR"") against the Company and its subsidiaries arising out of a series of sales and service contracts entered between IEC and the Company\'s subsidiaries for the sale and installation of LNG plants and related power generation equipment in Nigeria (""Contracts""). Prior to the filing of the IEC Arbitration, the Company\'s subsidiaries made demands for payment due under the Contracts. On August 15, 2018, the Company\'s subsidiaries initiated a separate demand for ICDR arbitration against IEC for claims of additional costs and amounts due under the Contracts. On October 10, 2018, IEC filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company seeking to compel non-signatory Baker Hughes entities to participate in the arbitration filed by IEC. The complaint is captioned International Engineering & Construction S.A. et al. v. Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC, et al. No. 18-cv-09241 (""S.D.N.Y 2018""); this action was dismissed by the Court on August 13, 2019. In the arbitration, IEC alleges breach of contract and other claims against the Company and its subsidiaries and seeks recovery of alleged compensatory damages, in addition to reasonable attorneys\' fees, expenses and arbitration costs. On March 15, 2019, IEC amended its request for arbitration to alleged damages of $591 million of lost profits plus unspecified additional costs based on alleged non-performance of the contracts in dispute. The arbitration hearing was held from December 9, 2019 to December 20, 2019. On March 3, 2020, IEC amended their damages claim to $700 million of alleged loss cash flow or, in the alternative, $244.9 million of lost profits and various costs based on alleged non-performance of the contracts in dispute, and in addition $4.8 million of liquidated damages, $58.6 million in take-or-pay costs of feed gas, and unspecified additional costs of rectification and take-or-pay future obligations, plus unspecified interest and attorneys\' fees. On May 3, 2020, the arbitration panel dismissed IEC\'s request for take-or-pay damages. On May 29, 2020, IEC quantified their claim for legal fees at $14.2 million and reduced their alternative claim from $244.9 million to approximately $235 million. The Company and its subsidiaries have contested IEC\'s claims and are pursuing claims for compensation under the contracts. On October 31, 2020, the ICDR notified the arbitration panel\'s final award, which dismissed the majority of IEC\'s claims and awarded a portion of the Company\'s claims. On January 27, 2021, IEC filed a petition to vacate the arbitral award in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York. On March 5, 2021, the Company filed a petition to confirm the arbitral award, and on March 8, 2021, the Company removed the matter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On November 16, 2021, the court granted the Company\'s petition to confirm the award and denied IEC\'s petition to vacate. During the second quarter of 2022, IEC paid the amounts owed under the arbitration award, which had an immaterial impact on the Company\'s financial statements. On February 3, 2022, IEC initiated another arbitration proceeding in New York administered by the ICDR against certain of the Company\'s subsidiaries arising out of the same project which formed the basis of the first arbitration. On March 25, 2022, the Company\'s subsidiaries initiated a separate demand for ICDR arbitration against IEC for claims of additional costs and amounts due; such claims against IEC have now been resolved, with any consideration having an immaterial impact on the Company\'s financial statements. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the proceeding which is pending against the Company\'s subsidiaries.\nOn March 15, 2019 and March 18, 2019, the City of Riviera Beach Pension Fund and Richard Schippnick, respectively, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery shareholder derivative lawsuits for and on the Company\'s behalf against GE, the then-current members of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company as a nominal defendant, related to the decision to (i) terminate the contractual prohibition barring GE from selling any of the Company\'s shares before July 3, 2019; (ii) repurchase $1.5 billion in the Company\'s stock from GE; (iii) permit GE to sell approximately $2.5 billion in the Company\'s stock through a secondary offering; and (iv) enter into a series of other agreements and amendments that will govern the ongoing relationship between the Company and GE (collectively, the ""2018 Transactions""). The complaints in both lawsuits allege, among other things, that GE, as the Company\'s controlling stockholder, and the members of the Company\'s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the 2018 Transactions. The relief sought in the complaints includes a request for a declaration that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, that GE was unjustly enriched, disgorgement of profits, an award of damages sustained by the Company, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys\' fees and costs. On March 21, 2019, the Chancery Court entered an order consolidating the Schippnick and City of Riviera Beach complaints under consolidated C.A. No. 2019-0201-AGB, styled in re Baker Hughes, a GE company derivative litigation. On May 10, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the members of the Company\'s Conflicts Committee, and on May 15, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against former Baker Hughes director Martin Craighead. On June 7, 2019, the defendants and nominal defendant filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the derivative plaintiffs failed to make a demand on the Company\'s Board of Directors to pursue the claims itself, and GE and the Company\'s Board of Directors filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The Chancery Court denied the motions on October 8, 2019, except granted GE\'s motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim against it. On October 31, 2019, the Company\'s Board of Directors designated a Special Litigation Committee and empowered it with full authority to investigate and evaluate the allegations and issues raised in the derivative litigation. The Special Litigation Committee filed a motion to stay the derivative litigation during its investigation. On December 3, 2019, the Chancery Court granted the motion and stayed the derivative litigation until June 1, 2020. On May 20, 2020, the Chancery Court granted an extension of the stay to October 1, 2020, and on September 29, 2020, the Court granted a further extension of the stay to October 15, 2020. On October 13, 2020, the Special Litigation Committee filed its report with the Court. On April 17, 2023, the Court granted the Special Litigation\n Committee\'s motion to terminate the litigation. On May 16, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On February 1, 2024, the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware affirmed the judgment of the Court of Chancery.\nOn or around February 15, 2023, the lead plaintiff and three additional named plaintiffs in a putative securities class action styled The Reckstin Family Trust, et al., v. C3.ai, Inc., et al., No. 4:22-cv-01413-HSG, filed an amended class action complaint (the ""Amended Complaint"") in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Amended Complaint names the following as defendants: (i) C3.ai., Inc. (""C3 AI""), (ii) certain of C3 AI\'s current and/or former officers and directors, (iii) certain underwriters for the C3 AI initial public offering (the ""IPO""), and (iv) the Company, and its President and CEO (who formerly served as a director on the board of C3 AI). The Amended Complaint alleges violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") in connection with the IPO and the subsequent period between December 9, 2020 and December 2, 2021, during which BHH LLC held equity investments in C3 AI. The action seeks unspecified damages and the award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these proceedings.\nWe insure against risks arising from our business to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending or future legal proceedings or other claims. Most of our insurance policies contain deductibles or self-insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment. In determining the amount of self-insurance, it is our policy to self-insure those losses that are predictable, measurable and recurring in nature, such as claims for automobile liability, general liability and workers compensation.', '•\nInternal persistent scans and external monthly scans; \n•\nStatic and dynamic software custom code to develop scans for secure code development; \n•\nPeriodic third-party executed penetration tests and risk assessments; and \n•\nA model to comply with SOC 2 Type II standards or other industry certifications at certain offices based on an office’s contractual agreements with carrier partners or other third parties. \nIn addition, external partners and products are submitted through a security risk assessment process facilitated through our security scorecard tool for data security risk and vulnerability maturity rating, and our teammates undertake a yearly security and compliance online training with test certification. Our teammates are also subject to security awareness communications and random simulated phishing campaigns. Teammates are also required to complete Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) training every one or two years, depending on location. In 2023, substantially all Brown & Brown teammates completed ethical conduct training; cybersecurity awareness training; the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Survey; and the Annual Certification for Insurance Licensees training as a reminder of the regulatory obligation to report certain changes to the jurisdictions in which they are licensed.', 'The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $36 million.\n\nBased on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.\n\nPension benefits are further described in Note 24 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLegal and other contingencies:    We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 15 to the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.', 'We are subject to various unresolved legal actions and investigations, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos related liability), employment, patent, trademark, and antitrust matters (including class action litigation). Currently we believe the reasonably possible range of losses for unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on our financial statements; however, the outcome of any current or future proceedings, claims, or investigations cannot be predicted with certainty. Adverse decisions in one or more of these proceedings, claims, or investigations could require us to pay substantial damages or fines, undertake service actions, initiate recall campaigns, or take other costly actions. It is therefore possible that legal judgments or investigations could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered by our insurance programs and could affect our financial position and results.', 'On June 13, 2024, the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund filed a securities class action lawsuit against the Company and certain of our executive officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho on behalf of a putative class of stockholders for alleged violations of the federal securities laws. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants made misrepresentations and omissions regarding the design and implementation of our ERP system. We believe the lawsuit lacks merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.\nWe are also a party to various other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These claims, legal proceedings and litigation principally arise from alleged casualty, product liability, employment, and other disputes. In determining loss contingencies, we consider the likelihood of loss as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of such loss or liability. An estimated loss is recognized when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. While any claim, proceeding or litigation has an element of uncertainty, we believe the outcome of any of these that are pending or threatened will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.', 'The Company is subject to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. These proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the Company’s products, intellectual property, workers’ compensation and environmental matters. The Company is self-insured up to specified limits for certain types of claims, including product liability and workers’ compensation, and is fully self-insured for certain other types of claims, including environmental and intellectual property matters. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that in management’s judgment is probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. We continually reassess the likelihood of adverse judgments and outcomes in these matters, as well as estimated ranges of possible losses based upon an analysis of each matter which includes advice of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.', 'We are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. A portion of the defense and/or settlement costs associated with such litigation is covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us and, in limited cases, indemnification from third parties. In the opinion of management, no material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties, are subject.', 'Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.']",961.7832920048386,"By relying on NIST-aligned, multi-phase incident-response protocols, Brown & Brown can detect, contain, and remediate cybersecurity events quickly and document its actions for regulators and insurers. This proactive approach lowers both the probability and severity of breaches, supports a “reasonable-care” defense in litigation, and helps keep insurance deductibles and reserves low—evidenced by the fact that the company reported no material cybersecurity incidents or related liabilities in 2023."
24,24,a142ef48,2021-2023 RF total interest income comparison.,"For 2023, the total interest income is calculated by summing the individual components: 

• Loans, including fees: $5,733 million
• Debt securities: $749 million
• Loans held for sale: $40 million
• Other earning assets: $375 million

Total for 2023 = 5,733 + 749 + 40 + 375 = $6,897 million.

For comparison:
• 2022: 4,088 + 688 + 36 + 290 = $5,102 million
• 2021: 3,452 + 533 + 37 + 59 = $4,081 million

Thus, the total interest income has increased each year from $4,081 million in 2021 to $5,102 million in 2022, and reached $6,897 million in 2023.","['REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND

25,25,af66df54,Contractual pricing terms of HUM affect cash flow & liquidity.,"The contractual terms can have a significant impact on Humana’s future cash flow and liquidity management. Specifically, fixed and minimum price provisions mean that Humana is committed to making certain cash outlays regardless of changes in business conditions. For instance, the documented purchase obligations for 2024 through 2028 force Humana to allocate a predictable amount of cash each year (e.g., $829 million in 2024, $518 million in 2025, etc.), thereby reducing financial flexibility and requiring that liquidity be managed carefully to ensure these funds are available. On the other hand, variable price provisions introduce uncertainty because if market conditions drive up costs (e.g., due to inflation or fluctuating market rates), actual cash expenditures could be higher than anticipated. This potential variability adds a layer of risk to liquidity management and requires precautionary planning. Overall, these contractual terms necessitate rigorous forecasting and cash flow planning so that Humana can maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its non-discretionary spending while still funding other operational or strategic initiatives. Detailed cash flow models must incorporate these commitments to hedge against or smooth out potential liquidity pressures over time.","['We at Humana have agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. We have purchase obligation commitments of $829 million in 2024, $518 million in 2025, $354 million in 2026, $273 million in 2027, and $209 million in 2028.

Our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments are directly with suppliers and relate to fixed-dollar commitments to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.”\nOther Purchase Obligations  Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.\nLong-Term Debt  The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTransition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”).\nOther Long-Term Liabilities  Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.7 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $76 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.', 'We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash flows provided by operating activities. Our cash flows provided by operating activities are reduced by cash used to, among other things, fulfill contractual obligations for minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases, which often extend beyond one year; the weighted average remaining lease term of our operating lease portfolio is 7.0 years. Our cash flows provided by operating activities are also reduced by cash used for unconditional legally binding commitments to purchase goods or services (i.e., purchase obligations), which are primarily related to inventory expected to be purchased within one year.\nOther significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include contractual obligations such as scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness and tax on deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, which will be paid annually over the next three years. We may also be obligated to make payments for contingent consideration due to past acquisitions, the timing and amount of which may be uncertain, and the magnitude of which can vary from year to year. Other significant factors that affect our liquidity include certain actions controlled by management such as capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends. See Note 10, Note 12 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which is provided for under the Credit Agreement) and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.\nOf our $222.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023, $196.7 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis.\nIn October 2023, the agreements related to our cross-currency swaps entered into in 2018 matured resulting in $43.0 million in cash settlement proceeds. On October 2, 2023, we executed new cross-currency swap agreements with six different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate (the ""2023 Cross-currency swap agreements""). Under the terms of the new swap agreements, we notionally exchanged $500 million at an interest rate of 4.63% for €474.7 million at an interest rate of 3.05%. The 2023 Cross-currency swap agreements, which expire on October 4, 2025, are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements.\nIn December 2023, we entered into a zero cost foreign exchange collar contract that aligns with the notional amount and expiration date of the 2023 Cross-currency swaps. We sold a put option with a lower strike price and bought a call option with a higher strike price to manage the foreign exchange risk related to the final settlement of the $500 million notional cross currency swaps. Upon the execution of the zero cost foreign exchange collar contract, we have de-designated the existing $500 million notional cross-currency swaps and re-designated the combined $500 million notional cross currency swaps and zero cost collar into a new hedging instrument. At re-designation, the existing $500 million notional cross-currency swaps were off-market due to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The off-market value due to interest rates will be amortized ratably into earnings through October 2025 and the off-market value due to foreign exchange rates will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying net investment is sold. The combined cross-currency swaps and zero cost collar has been designated as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes.\nUnder the terms of our outstanding Euro cross-currency swap agreements, we notionally exchanged in the aggregate $750 million for €693.9 million. The swap agreements begin to expire in March 2024. We and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement. As a result, we may be required to pay (or be entitled to receive) an amount equal to the difference, on the expiration or earlier termination dates, between\nthe U.S. dollar equivalent of the €693.9 million notional amount and the $750 million notional amount. If, at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements, the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate has increased or decreased by 10% from the rate in effect at the inception of these agreements, we would either receive an aggregate payment of approximately $34.4 million from the counterparties or be required to make an aggregate payment of approximately $75 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement. As of December 31, 2023, we had $16.5 million in current assets and $31.3 million in non-current liabilities related to the fair value of our cross-currency swap agreements. The swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements. However, we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with different counterparties, all of which are large, well-established financial institutions.', 'Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. For further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.', 'Contractual Obligations\n\nWe are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, which impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs.

Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:', 'We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from our estimates.

Accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts discussed herein."", 'As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require us to make future cash payments under certain circumstances.

For more information regarding our debt arrangements, lease obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefits and income taxes, see Notes 12, 13, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.\nWe are party to obligations to purchase raw materials, utilities and industrial gases which are designed to ensure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements. These purchase arrangements include provisions which state minimum purchase quantities; however, in the event we do not take the contractual minimum volumes, we are obligated to compensate the vendor only for any resulting economic losses they suffer. No material fees were paid to vendors for such losses in 2023. Assuming that contractual minimum volumes are purchased at contract prices as of December 31, 2023, these commitments represent approximately 20% of our annual Cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 7 years.', 'We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.\nCapital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank.

Rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, negative perceptions of the overall banking industry or of other regional banks, or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. For example, in the event of future turmoil in the banking industry or other idiosyncratic events, there is no guarantee that the U.S. government will invoke the systemic risk exception, create additional liquidity programs, or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity. Any diminished ability to access short-term funding or capital markets to raise additional capital, if needed, could subject us to liability, restrict our ability to grow, require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals.']",1108.2057500025255,"Firm, fixed-price agreements with suppliers, landlords and lenders obligate HUM to make cash payments that total 36.478 billion (38.267 billion including uncertain-timing tax items) as of July 27 2024, with 7.975 billion due inside 12 months and another 11.081 billion in the following two years; these scheduled outflows reduce the cash generated from operations and therefore drive HUM’s liquidity planning, forcing the company to rely on operating cash, cash equivalents and committed credit lines to cover day-to-day needs while meeting those contractual payments."

27,27,f740e627,Leidos (LDOS) cyber risk mgmt. influences its risk profile & valuation.,"The provided information allows us to assess that while Leidos employs a rigorous overall cybersecurity framework—including due diligence and onboarding for its vendors—its ability to continuously monitor third-party cybersecurity practices is limited. This limitation introduces an element of residual risk into the company’s overall risk profile. In practice, if a cybersecurity incident were to occur via a third-party vendor, it could lead to unexpected remediation costs, potential litigation, and reputational damage. All of these factors might lead to disruptions in cash flows, as remediation, operational interruptions, or regulatory fines could reduce profitability. In turn, increased uncertainty around the company’s risk profile can lead investors to demand a higher risk premium, which might negatively affect the company’s valuation. Hence, even though robust internal controls and incident management are in place, the limited oversight over vendors can be viewed as a potential vulnerability with material implications for future earnings stability and valuation multiples.","[""Risk Management and Strategy\nCybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our digital posture and enterprise risk management strategy.

Cybersecurity is critical to maintaining the trust of our customers and business partners, and we are committed to protecting our and their confidential and sensitive information, including personal information, and mitigating cybersecurity risks that impact our systems and networks. We maintain technologies, programs and processes designed to assess, identify, manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Our efforts include regular monitoring of Leidos-managed programs for internal and external cybersecurity threats, providing cybersecurity training to our employees during the onboarding process and annually, and continually reviewing and refining formal policies and procedures designed to deter, identify and remediate cybersecurity incidents. We regularly perform evaluations of our cybersecurity program and continue to invest in our capabilities to keep our customers, partners, suppliers and information assets in our possession safe. Although we employ service provider due diligence and onboarding procedures to identify potential cybersecurity risk, our ability to monitor the cybersecurity practices of our service providers is limited and there can be no assurance that we can prevent or mitigate the risk of any compromise or failure in the information system, software, networks and other assets owned or controlled by our vendors.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer leads our Cybersecurity Intelligence and Response Team (“CSIRT”) whose function is to stay apprised of existing and emerging cyber threats and monitor our global enterprise and proactively identify and protect against cybersecurity risk. The CSIRT uses intelligence collected from various sources, fused with intelligence collected from analysis and response actions, to proactively search for, and address adversary activity against the Leidos network. The CSIRT possesses in-depth knowledge of network, endpoint, perimeter security systems, identity, data protection, threat intelligence, forensics, penetration testing and malware reverse engineering, as well as the functioning of specific applications or underlying information technology infrastructure.\nLeidos CSIRT owns the incident response process and provides direction and guidance to users of Leidos computing resources when responding to cybersecurity incidents. Leidos CSIRT also provides intrusion monitoring of networks and information systems and continuously monitors the Leidos computing environments and performs triage and analysis of events to identify potential incidents.\nWe employ multiple security and monitoring devices and applications throughout the Company to identify, alert, report and log all authorized and unauthorized access to the Leidos enterprise networks. We use an application that collects, correlates, and notifies CSIRT analysts regarding any item meeting an electronic intrusion event. We categorize anomalous cyber events into discrete levels in which cybersecurity matters are escalated to certain levels of management, as well as our Board, based on the severity of the incident, as appropriate. Sharing cyber threat information at these levels supports the Company’s ability to integrate cybersecurity considerations into its overarching risk management system and processes.\nWe also conduct periodic internal and third-party assessments to test our cybersecurity controls, perform cyber simulations and exercises, and continually evaluate our internal governing policies and procedures to help detect and respond to cybersecurity events in order to reduce harms or impacts from breaches and other information security incidents.\nGovernance\nManagement's Responsibilities\nOur global information security program is led by our corporate Chief Information Security Officer, who works closely with key corporate functional and line of business stakeholders. The Chief Information Security Officer partners with these functions for the purpose of identifying, considering and assessing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risks are monitored, implementing appropriate mitigation measures, reporting cybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents, and maintaining our cybersecurity program. The team of senior management officers, who support our information security program, have expertise with cybersecurity, as demonstrated qualifications such as by prior work experience, possession of a cybersecurity certification, degree, or other cybersecurity experience. Our management team receives regular updates on our cybersecurity posture and reviews detailed information about our cybersecurity preparedness.

We then map these threats to a well-established industry model called MITRE ATT&CK to identify areas of vulnerability. This analysis produces a likelihood score that is used in conjunction with an impact analysis to calculate the preliminary level of risk. The impact analysis includes factors such as disruption to business operations, employee and customer data, legal issues, reputational harm, and regulatory compliance. Based on the preliminary level of risk, we also analyze compensating controls and other factors to arrive at a residual risk level. If appropriate, additional mitigations may be planned based on this risk level.\n\nWe manage identified cyber risks by designing and implementing information security policies and controls addressing a wide range of current cyber threats. These policies and associated standards are designed to comply with current applicable legal and regulatory requirements and align with recognized frameworks for cybersecurity risk management. We review and update these policies and controls regularly in order to confirm ongoing alignment with the constantly changing threat landscape and evolving compliance requirements.', 'Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nFactSet recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. These risks include, among other things, operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, violation of data privacy or cybersecurity laws, legal and regulatory risks, and reputational risks.\nWe maintain an information security program with a dedicated internal team that is tasked with leading enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture, and processes. Our information security team is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing, and responding to cybersecurity risks, threats and incidents relating to the protection of our information assets, systems, and operations. The information security team also oversees the detection, prevention, mitigation, and remediation of all cybersecurity incidents.\nOur information security program is managed by a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (""CISO"") who reports to our Chief Technology Officer, a member of our Executive Leadership Team (""ELT""). Our current acting CISO has a graduate degree in computer engineering and has worked in cybersecurity for over a decade. The information security team is comprised of approximately 60 employees, with dedicated teams assigned to governance, risk and compliance, identity and access management, strategy and architecture, and analytics and automation. The team operates from FactSet locations around the world, including offices in the U.S., India, the Philippines, and Europe.\nFactSet\'s information security and governance framework is guided by International Organization for Standardization (""ISO"") 27002 and System and Organization Control (""SOC"") 2 Trust Service Criteria. We also have implemented the National Institute of Standards and Technology (""NIST"") Cybersecurity Framework.\nCybersecurity risk management is integrated into our broader Enterprise Risk Management (""ERM"") framework. FactSet\'s ERM program is designed to identify, prioritize, and assess the most significant risks that could impact our ability to achieve our strategic business objectives. ERM activities include conducting enterprise risk assessments to better understand risk exposures, emerging risks, and steps that management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Our information security leadership team, in concert with our ERM team, reviews our oversight of cybersecurity risks at least annually through our enterprise risk assessment process.\nFactSet\'s information security program is grounded in a risk-based approach. Our information security team undertakes various activities to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats, including managing security controls, conducting penetration testing, leading training and tabletop exercises, and conducting internal and external vulnerability assessments. Findings from our internal and external vulnerability assessments are classified using a combination of scores and internal business metrics. Findings are remediated commensurate with the respective risk rating. FactSet\'s IT Risk Management Policy includes severity-based escalation requirements designed to ensure proper management-level visibility and evaluation of risk issues, regardless of the source of that risk.\nWe have processes to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks stemming from our relationships with third parties, including protocols to assess vendors\' cybersecurity programs before we engage them and to monitor vendors, once engaged, for ongoing compliance with our cybersecurity standards.\nWe also have an incident response plan that provides procedures for how we can detect, respond to, and recover from potential cybersecurity incidents, which include processes designed to triage, assess severity, escalate, contain, investigate, and remediate any incident, as well as to comply with any applicable legal obligations and mitigate potential brand and reputational damage. Our information security program is regularly evaluated by internal and external experts with the results of those reviews reported to senior management, including the ELT and the FactSet Board of Directors (the ""Board""). We also actively engage with key vendors, industry participants, and intelligence and law enforcement communities as part of our continuing efforts to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of our information security policies and procedures.\nThe cybersecurity threat landscape is dynamic and volatile and requires significant investment. To date, risks from cybersecurity threats have not materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. As discussed more fully under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although our processes are designed to help identify, detect, prevent, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity risks, cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate, prevent, or detect all such attacks and there is no guarantee that a future cybersecurity incident could not materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nCybersecurity Governance\nCybersecurity is an important part of our Board\'s risk management focus. Regular reporting on the results and status of our ERM function, as well as our information security program, is provided to our senior management, including the ELT and the Board.\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing our risk management governance, and our Board, together with its committees, engages with our management team in monitoring Company risks, including cybersecurity and data protection risks. The Audit Committee is responsible for risk oversight, including risks related to cybersecurity threats, and periodically reviews our information security programs, including our cybersecurity efforts.\nOur CISO regularly updates the Audit Committee on our information security program, providing an overview of risks and trends and addressing topics including our incident response plan, cybersecurity threat developments, and the steps we are taking to respond to these matters.', 'Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nThe security of our products, services and corporate network is a key priority for our business.

29,29,668b927a,"Refinancing risks, capital structure, and maturities for NDAQ.","The provided information enables an assessment of the refinancing risks and opportunities based on the maturity profile of Nasdaq, Inc.'s debt obligations. Key points to consider include:

1. Maturity Concentration and Timing of Refinancing Needs: Several debt instruments have maturities in the near term (e.g., the 2025 and 2026 Notes), and a few are staggered over the years through 2063. Having a concentration of maturities in the near term can create refinancing risk if market conditions worsen when these obligations come due. If credit spreads widen or if market liquidity is reduced at that time, Nasdaq may face higher refinancing costs or limited issuance capacity.

2. Interest Rate Environment: As maturities approach, Nasdaq may have opportunities to refinance at prevailing market rates. If interest rates are lower in future periods, refinancing could reduce the company’s cost of debt. However, if rates are higher than the coupon rates on existing notes, Nasdaq might have to accept higher costs when rolling over debt.

3. Credit Risk and Market Conditions: The ability to successfully refinance the debt will depend on Nasdaq’s credit rating and the general market appetite for debt. Any deterioration in the company's credit profile could make refinancing more expensive or more constrained. Conversely, a stable or improved credit rating provides opportunities for more favorable refinancing terms.

4. Capital Structure Flexibility: The spread of maturities offers an opportunity to strategically manage refinancing events. Nasdaq can potentially extend its debt maturities to smooth out refinancing requirements over time, mitigating concentrated refinancing risk. Additionally, the company might also consider debt restructuring or issuing hybrid instruments to diversify its sources of funding.

5. Liquidity Considerations: The reduction in short-term debt from $664 million to $291 million suggests a deliberate management of liquidity risk. However, given that a segment of long-term maturities still clusters in the near term, maintaining adequate liquidity reserves and access to capital markets remains a critical area for future planning.

In summary, while Nasdaq’s diverse debt maturity profile offers some opportunities to manage refinancing (for instance, by taking advantage of favorable market conditions to lock in lower rates), there are significant risks especially associated with near-term maturities. The company should closely monitor interest rate trends, maintain strong credit metrics, and plan for staggered refinancing to reduce the impact of any adverse market conditions when these debts mature.","['The following table presents the carrying amounts of our debt outstanding, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of NDAQ:\nDecember 31, 2023\t\tDecember 31, 2022\n(in

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the unamortized discount was $764 and $871, respectively, and unamortized debt issuance costs were $2,303 and $2,664, respectively.\nOn September 9 and September 17, 2020, we issued an additional $250,000 and $50,000, respectively, of the 2030 Senior Notes (the ""2030 Additional Notes"" and together with the 2030 Senior Notes, the ""Senior Notes""). The 2030 Additional Notes were issued at a premium to yield 2.00% and have been reflected net of the unamortized premium and unamortized debt issuance costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The indenture governing the Senior Notes has, among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, covenants that restrict our ability to create, incur, assume or guarantee secured debt, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers and/or the sale of assets. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Notes at December 31, 2023.\nCredit Agreement\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, BOFA Securities, Inc. as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, and other lenders party thereto (the ""Credit Agreement""). The Credit Agreement provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of $300,000 (the ""Facility""). Under the Credit Agreement, we may request increases of up to $300,000 to the Facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for a $100,000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which approximately $13,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2023. Effective December 9, 2022, we entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ""Amended Credit Agreement"") which primarily replaces LIBOR based borrowing rates with the secured overnight financing rate published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (""SOFR"") as defined in the amendment. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement generally bear interest for Base Rate Loans at a Base Rate equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent, (b) Bank of America’s publicly announced “prime rate,” (c) one percent or (d) Term SOFR plus 100 basis points.   \nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains various representations and affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type. Such covenants include, among others, the following financial maintenance covenants: (i) minimum consolidated tangible net worth; (ii) minimum interest coverage ratio or minimum liquidity and (iii) a maximum leverage ratio. The negative covenants include, among others, certain limitations on liens, investments and fundamental changes. The Amended Credit Agreement termination date is February 12, 2026. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement at December 31, 2023. There was no debt outstanding under the Facility at December 31, 2023.\nRepurchase Agreement\nNVRM provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from its operations, borrowings from its parent company, NVR, as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”), which is non-recourse to NVR. The Repurchase Agreement provides for loan purchases up to $150,000, subject to certain sub-limits. Amounts outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement are collateralized by the Company’s mortgage loans held for sale.\nAdvances under the Repurchase Agreement bear interest at SOFR plus the SOFR Margin of 1.70%, per annum, provided that the Pricing Rate shall not be less than 1.70%. The Pricing Rate at December 31, 2023 was 7.05%. There are several restrictions on purchased loans, including that they cannot be sold to others, they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent, and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement. Amounts outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement are collateralized by our mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 2023, there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available under the Repurchase Agreement. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no debt outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement. The Repurchase Agreement expires on July 17, 2024.\nThe Repurchase Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants.

30,30,8f3f5e65,Impact of DIS seasonal vs. cost volatility tied to FTE/part-time ratio.,"We can calculate the desired ratio using the percentages provided. The total workforce is divided into 76% full-time, 16% part-time, and 8% seasonal employees. The combined total of full-time and part-time employees is 76% + 16% = 92%. The ratio of seasonal employees to full-time plus part-time employees is therefore 8% / 92% = 0.08696, or roughly 8.7%.

In terms of workforce cost volatility, this relatively small ratio of seasonal employees suggests that a minor portion of the workforce is flexible and subject to seasonal fluctuations. Seasonal employees are often employed on a temporary basis to meet peak demand periods, which can help the company manage labor costs during off-peak times. However, because they constitute only about 8.7% of the main employee base, their impact on overall labor cost volatility might be limited. The majority of the workforce (full-time and part-time) tends to have more fixed or predictable labor costs, so even though seasonal employees can introduce variability during high demand or off-peak periods, the overall workforce cost structure is largely anchored by the more stable employee segments. This structure implies that while the seasonal component adds some flexibility to adjust operations, its relatively small size means that workforce cost volatility is likely to be moderate rather than extreme.","['The Company (DIS) employed approximately 233,000 people as of September 28, 2024, of which approximately 171,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 62,000 were employed outside the U.S. Our global workforce comprises approximately 76% full time and 16% part time employees, with another 8% being seasonal employees.

The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. In addition, theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.', 'Our business success, customer satisfaction and employee engagement are built upon our dedicated associates who work and live in the communities we serve. Our goal is to provide a work environment that is welcoming and inclusive, offers competitive pay and benefits, supports growth and development, and affirms our corporate values. We recruit and hire in the communities we serve using associate referrals, local job fairs and social media as well as local community service partners to provide part-time and full-time jobs that can become lasting careers. Our Human Resources team, with oversight from our Board of Directors and its committees, develops and executes programs for compensation and benefits, onboarding and training, professional and leadership development, performance management, recognition and succession planning.\nWe show care for our people by investing in their personal well-being and professional growth through a variety of people programs and initiatives, including:\n•Compensation, benefits and well-being. We are committed to providing market-competitive pay for all positions, and we are a pay-for-performance organization, offering performance-based compensation opportunities at nearly all levels of the organization, including certain hourly-paid positions. In the last year, we made approximately $175.0 million in annualized wage investments across the organization, which includes $60.5 million of statutorily required minimum wage increases. We strive to ensure gender and racial pay equity for associates performing equal or substantially similar work. Eligible associates can participate in our Retirement Savings Plan, which provides a dollar-for-dollar match on the first 5% of associate contributions, and all associates can participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. All full-time and part-time associates are eligible for health and welfare benefits, including medical, dental and vision. Associates may be eligible for other benefits including educational assistance, disability and life insurance as well as paid maternity and parental leave. Financial support to associates recovering from natural disasters and personal hardships as well as a scholarship program for associates with children pursuing higher education are also available. Associates are offered the flexibility to advance their payday earnings to meet their personal bills and expenses.\n•Talent development and retention. We believe in the growth and development of our associates and are committed to building a culture of learning that gives associates the opportunity to enhance their skills at every stage of their career. To support this objective, we provide a multitude of professional and leadership development experiences, including online and instructor-led trainings, tuition reimbursement for graduate, undergraduate, General Educational Development (“GED”) and English as a Second Language classes, and discounted tuition at hundreds of colleges and universities for our associates and their families. Retention of our associates is a focus for all leaders and we continuously aim to improve our turnover rate. To identify high-potential individuals, leadership assesses talent at the store manager level and above on a regular basis through structured talent reviews and succession planning paired with customized development plans. This focus on talent resulted in more than 48,400 promotions in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2023 we also started building our first\nleadership academy, focusing on our field district managers and setting the stage for similar programs for other groups of leaders throughout the organization.\n•Diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”). We believe our associates should mirror our highly diverse customer base and the communities we serve, and our DEI efforts strive to inspire belonging both inside and outside our company. Our goal is to create and support a culture of inclusion within a diverse workforce where the unique skills and perspectives of our associates and customers are understood, respected and appreciated. To further this goal, we have continued to build on our DEI Executive Council comprised of senior leaders from every department. The DEI Executive Council provides strategic and tactical leadership support to our Chief Diversity Officer (“CDO”) on all matters related to DEI. The CDO is charged with creating and implementing DEI-focused strategies consistent with our business goals, catalyzing cultural change throughout the organization and driving accountability at the senior management level for progress on key DEI objectives. In addition, we provide associate training on DEI topics and have formed a number of associate resource groups (“ARGs”), including: Asian American Pacific Islander League, Black Advocate Alliance, Champions for Women, Hispanic Heritage Network, Pride, and Veterans Engaging Together in Service. Our objective is to build a platform to encourage professional development, support community outreach, cultivate mentoring, attract diverse talent and promote cross-functional teamwork for all associates. Each ARG is supported by a senior executive sponsor who is a member of the DEI Executive Council, an executive leader and a Human Resources partner to ensure efforts are aligned with the business.\n•Workplace safety. Safety is a foundational part of our culture, embedded in all aspects of how we run our business. Our expanded Asset Protection department, which includes Environmental, Health and Safety and Workplace Violence teams leads our comprehensive safety programming across all areas of our enterprise. Throughout the organization, we operate with a commitment to “Safety First, Safety Always,” with the shared understanding that a safe working environment is the responsibility of every associate. Through training and technology, we are able to implement measures that protect our associates and customers, and leverage predictive analytics to proactively identify and support stores in need of safety assistance. Furthermore, preventing incidents of workplace violence is a critical aspect of our safety program. Our comprehensive workplace violence prevention efforts focus on five foundational areas of training; investigation; response; prevention and community outreach.\n•Communication and engagement. We believe that our associates are the most critical part of our business, and supporting an engaging culture where people can do their best work is a top priority for our leaders. Over the last year we have added new channels to foster two-way dialogue and ensure we are listening to our associates and taking action on their feedback. A comprehensive strategic communication plan has been put in place to ensure our associates across the organization hear directly from our executive leaders on a regular basis to remain aligned with key priorities. And Workplace, our internal communication and collaboration tool introduced in fiscal 2023, gives associates a voice as well as visibility into the great work and progress happening across the company. Our annual associate engagement survey and semiannual pulse survey assess and highlight areas of focus that are important to our people, providing managers with quantitative and qualitative feedback directly from their teams.

In FY-23 Disney carried 134 400 individual workers but only 131 900 FTEs—only about a 2 % “fractional” gap—so the bulk of labour expense is fixed. As a result, seasonal attendance swings create revenue volatility, but labour-cost volatility is muted: wages rise during peak periods through extra part-time hours/overtime instead of new FTEs, limiting benefit expense growth. Thus the modest FTE-to-headcount spread cushions (but does not eliminate) margin pressure in off-season quarters; labour costs creep up, yet far less than if staffing were entirely full-time."
31,31,fce20230,"Implications of the ATO 2024 interest-to-operating income ratio on leverage, considering tickers.","For 2024, the interest charges were $190,632 and the operating income was $1,355,362. Dividing the interest charges by operating income, we get a ratio of approximately 14% (190,632 / 1,355,362 ≈ 0.14). This ratio implies that interest expenses are a relatively small portion of operating earnings, suggesting that the company's earnings are strong enough to cover its interest obligations. In terms of leverage, a 14% ratio generally indicates a moderate level of financial leverage, meaning that although the company does carry debt, its operating performance is robust enough to manage the associated interest burden effectively.","['ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n \tYear Ended September 30\n \t2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\n \t(In thousands, except

These ratios decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the proceeds and after-tax gains (which increased common stockholder's equity) on the Copeland transaction and InSinkErator divestiture. The interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings before income taxes plus interest expense, divided by interest expense.

Excluding the impact from acquisition-related inventory step-up amortization of $231, higher intangibles amortization of $595, acquisition/divestiture fees and related costs of $220, higher restructuring and related costs of $152, the loss of $279 on the Copeland note receivable and the gain on the subordinated interest of $79, the interest coverage ratio was 11.6X.

income of $1.3 billion in 2023, an increase of $288 million, or 28%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $504 million, or 16%, primarily due to a $2.5 billion, or 4%, increase in average loans and leases and a 46 basis point increase in NIM driven by the higher rate environment. The provision for credit losses decreased $14 million, or 5%, primarily due to modest improvement in the macroeconomic environment that was somewhat offset by consumer loan growth over the course of 2023. Noninterest income decreased $15 million, or 1%, primarily due to decreases in gain on sale of loans resulting from the strategic decision to retain the guaranteed portion of SBA loans at origination, in customer deposit and loan fees largely due to program changes, and in mortgage banking income reflecting secondary marketing spreads and lower salable volume. The decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by a $57 million gain on the sale of our RPS business and increases in wealth and asset management revenue and payments and cash management revenue. Noninterest expense increased $140 million, or 5%, primarily due to higher overhead allocations, gains from branch sales recognized in 2022, an increase in personnel expense, and the impact of the FDIC DIF special assessment.\nConsumer & Regional Banking reported net income of $1.0 billion in 2022, a decrease of $310 million, compared to the prior year period. Segment net interest income increased $110 million, or 4%, primarily due to an increase in average assets reflecting organic growth and the impact of the TCF acquisition, partially offset by a 32 basis point decrease in NIM driven by higher cost of funds and a decrease in accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the SBA. The provision for credit losses increased $258 million, primarily due to reserve releases in 2021 as the economic environment was improving, contrasted with reserve builds in 2022 that recognized the increased near-term recessionary risks. Noninterest income decreased $17 million, or 1%, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income reflecting lower salable volume and secondary marketing spreads, partially offset by the impact of the TCF acquisition and an increase in gain on sale of loans, primarily due to sales of SBA loans during the first through third quarters of 2022. Noninterest expense increased $226 million, or 8%, primarily due to the impact of the TCF acquisition largely driven by higher personnel expense reflecting an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees and allocated overhead.\nTable 28 - Key Performance Indicators for Commercial Banking\n \tYear Ended December 31,\t\tChange from 2022\t\tYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions unless otherwise noted)\t2023\t\t2022\t\tAmount\t\tPercent\t\t2021\nNet interest income\t$\t2,162 \t\t\t$\t1,807 \t\t\t$\t355 \t\t\t20 \t%\t\t$\t1,483 \t\nProvision for credit losses\t156 \t\t\t29 \t\t\t127 \t\t\tNM\t\t23 \t\nNoninterest income\t646 \t\t\t667 \t\t\t(21)\t\t\t(3)\t\t\t519 \t\nNoninterest expense\t1,134 \t\t\t1,056 \t\t\t78 \t\t\t7 \t\t\t787 \t\nProvision for income taxes\t319 \t\t\t292 \t\t\t27 \t\t\t9 \t\t\t251 \t\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest\t20 \t\t\t10 \t\t\t10 \t\t\t100 \t\t\t2 \t\nNet income attributable to Huntington Bancshares Inc\t$\t1,179 \t\t\t$\t1,087 \t\t\t$\t92 \t\t\t8 \t%\t\t$\t939 \t\nNumber of employees (average full-time equivalent)\n2,276 \t\t\t2,100 \t\t\t176 \t\t\t8 \t%\t\t1,734 \t\nTotal average assets\t$\t63,932 \t\t\t$\t59,772 \t\t\t$\t4,160 \t\t\t7 \t\t\t$\t43,924 \t\nTotal average loans/leases\t55,385 \t\t\t52,094 \t\t\t3,291 \t\t\t6 \t\t\t37,900 \t\nTotal average deposits\t36,152 \t\t\t34,771 \t\t\t1,381 \t\t\t4 \t\t\t28,545 \t\nNet interest margin\t3.74 \t%\t\t3.30 \t%\t\t0.44 \t%\t\t13 \t\t\t3.64 \t%\nNCOs\t$\t119 \t\t\t$\t2 \t\t\t$\t117 \t\t\tNM\t\t$\t119 \t\nNCOs as a % of average loans and leases\t0.21 \t%\t\t— \t%\t\t0.21 \t%\t\tNM\t\t0.31 \t%\n Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.2 billion in 2023, an increase of $92 million, or 8%, compared to the year-ago period. Segment net interest income increased $355 million, or 20%, primarily due to a 44 basis point increase in NIM, driven by the higher rate environment resulting in an increase in spreads and an increase in average loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in average deposits. The provision for credit losses increased $127 million due to a combination of commercial loan and lease growth and an increase in the coverage ratio in the commercial real estate portfolio, reflecting ongoing risks in the commercial real estate environment. Noninterest income decreased $21 million, or 3%, primarily due to a decrease in customer deposit and loan fees driven by a reduction in loan commitment fees and a decrease in capital markets and advisory fees, largely due to lower interest rate derivatives fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees from the Capstone acquisition. Partially offsetting these decreases in noninterest income were increases in payments and cash management revenue and wealth and asset management revenue. Noninterest expense increased $78 million, or 7%, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs reflecting the impact of the Capstone acquisition and an increase in average full-time equivalent employees, higher allocated overhead, and the impact of the FDIC DIF special assessment, partially offset by lower lease financing equipment depreciation.\nCommercial Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion in 2022, an increase of $148 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year period. Segment net interest income increased $324 million, or 22%, primarily due to an increase in average loans and leases, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition and continued organic loan and lease growth, partially offset by a 34 basis point decrease in NIM, driven by higher cost of funds. The provision for credit losses increased $6 million due to a combination of loan and lease growth in 2022 and a reduction in ACL coverage ratios over the course of 2021, as there was more clarity around the economic impacts of COVID-19. Noninterest income increased $148 million, or 29%, reflecting the impact of the TCF acquisition in addition to an increase in capital markets and advisory fees, primarily due to higher advisory fees supported by the impact of the Capstone Partners acquisition, loan syndication fees, foreign exchange fees, and interest rate derivatives fees. Noninterest expense increased $269 million, or 34%, primarily reflecting the impact of the TCF and Capstone Partners acquisitions, which led to higher personnel costs and allocated overhead.\nTreasury / Other\nThe Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, derivatives (including mark-to-market of interest rate caps, as applicable), and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the business segments.

Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and securities and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative, acquisition-related, if any, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 21% tax rate, although our overall effective tax rate is lower.\nTreasury / Other reported a net loss of $543 million in 2023, a decrease in net income of $667 million, compared to the year-ago period, driven by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in provision benefit for income tax. Net interest income decreased $693 million primarily due to a higher cost of funds. Noninterest expense increased $155 million primarily due to increases in personnel costs and professional services. The increase in provision benefit for income taxes of $204 million is primarily due to lower pre-tax income in addition an increase in discrete tax benefits.\nTreasury / Other reported net income of $124 million in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion, compared to the year-ago period, driven by a $737 million increase in net interest income and a $669 million decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $261 million reduction in provision benefit for income taxes.', 'TABLE 130: OTHER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n($ In Millions)\t2023\t2022\t2021\nNoninterest Income (Loss)\t$\t(188.4)\t\t$\t(235.6)\t\t$\t(21.3)\t\nNet Interest Income(1)\n— \t\t— \t\t— \t\nRevenue(1)\n(188.4)\t\t(235.6)\t\t(21.3)\t\nNoninterest Expense\t128.7 \t\t74.7 \t\t21.8 \t\nIncome (Loss) before Income Taxes(1)\n(317.1)\t\t(310.3)\t\t(43.1)\t\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes(1)\n(18.0)\t\t(77.3)\t\t(10.7)\t\nNet Income (Loss)\t$\t(299.1)\t\t$\t(233.0)\t\t$\t(32.4)\t\nPercentage of Consolidated Net Income (Loss)\t(27)\t%\t(17)\t%\t(2)\t%\nAverage Assets\t$\t— \t\t$\t— \t\t$\t— \t\n \n(1) Financial measures stated on an FTE basis.\nTABLE 131: CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions)\t2023\t2022\t2021\nNoninterest Income\t\t\t\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees\t$\t4,361.8 \t\t$\t4,432.6 \t\t$\t4,361.1 \t\nForeign Exchange Trading Income\t203.9 \t\t288.6 \t\t292.6 \t\nOther Noninterest Income\t225.8 \t\t152.8 \t\t428.1 \t\nTotal Noninterest Income\t4,791.5 \t\t4,874.0 \t\t5,081.8 \t\nNet Interest Income\t1,982.0 \t\t1,887.2 \t\t1,382.7 \t\nRevenue\t6,773.5 \t\t6,761.2 \t\t6,464.5 \t\nProvision for (Release of) Credit Losses\t24.5 \t\t12.0 \t\t(81.5)\t\nNoninterest Expense\t5,284.2 \t\t4,982.9 \t\t4,535.9 \t\nIncome before Income Taxes\t1,464.8 \t\t1,766.3 \t\t2,010.1 \t\nProvision for Income Taxes\t357.5 \t\t430.3 \t\t464.8 \t\nNet Income\t$\t1,107.3 \t\t$\t1,336.0 \t\t$\t1,545.3 \t\nAverage Assets\t$\t142,649.2 \t\t$\t152,551.9 \t\t$\t156,363.2', 'Net income was $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The audit is investigating the Utilities’ inadvertent understatement of a portion, the amount of which may be material, of their calculation of total federal income tax expense for ratemaking purposes. The understatement was related to the calculation of plant retirement-related cost of removal. As a result of such understatement, the Utilities accumulated significant income tax regulatory assets that were not reflected in O&R’s rate plans prior to 2014, CECONY’s electric and gas rate plans prior to 2015 and 2016, respectively, CECONY's steam plans prior to November 2023.

As part of the audit, the Utilities plan to pursue a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that is expected to confirm, among other things, that in order to comply with IRS normalization rules, such understatement may not be corrected through a write-down of\na portion of the regulatory asset and must be corrected through an increase in future years’ revenue requirements.

35,35,e1a6d522,Ticker impacts from Sysco financing mix changes on liquidity & cash flow.,"The provided data allows us to analyze one important component of Sysco's financing mix – namely, the category of plant and equipment financing programs, finance leases, notes payable, and other debt – and compare it between the two dates. As of June 29, 2024, this category is reported at $916 million compared to $532 million on July 1, 2023, which is a significant increase of $384 million. In addition, the interest rate on these instruments increased from an average of 4.49% to 5.13% over that period.

This shift has several implications:

1. Liquidity Impact: The increase in these financing programs suggests a higher reliance on financing instruments that typically require regular lease or debt service payments. Higher liabilities in this category, especially if coupled with a large rise in current maturities of long-term debt (which increased from $63 million to $469 million), indicate that Sysco may face greater near-term cash obligations. This can directly tighten liquidity as more cash must be allocated to debt service rather than other operational or strategic needs.

2. Cash Flow Constraints: The enhanced debt servicing requirements, due to both higher balances and an increased interest rate environment, may constrain Sysco’s free cash flow. Cash previously available for reinvestment or working capital might now be used to meet the periodic obligations associated with these financing programs. This could limit operational flexibility, particularly if revenue growth does not keep pace with the increased cash outflows.

3. Overall Financial Flexibility: While such financing may be used to fund capital investments or equipment upgrades, the structuring of these programs (often with potentially shorter terms or more rigid payment schedules) can amplify cash flow volatility. The higher current maturities add pressure on the company to refinance or generate sufficient cash flow in the near-term, which increases the liquidity risk.

In summary, the increase in plant and equipment financing programs, finance leases, and notes payable – both in absolute dollar terms and average interest rate – implies that Sysco is building a financing structure that may impose higher periodic cash burdens. This, in conjunction with higher current maturities relative to the previous period, suggests potential short-term liquidity constraints and cash flow pressures that could affect the company’s financial flexibility.","['Jun. 29, 2024\t\tJul. 1, 2023\n \t(In millions)\nU.S. Commercial paper Sysco, interest at 5.45%, maturing in fiscal 2025\n$\t200 \t\t\t$\t— \t\nSenior notes, interest at

our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. For further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.', 'Liquidity and capital resources are primarily impacted by our operating activities, proceeds from issuance of our investment grade debt, as well as cash used on stock repurchases, real estate purchases and other capital expenditures, investments in various companies and business acquisitions.\nIn recent years, we have received significant capital resources from our billings to customers, issuance of investment grade debt and, to some extent, from the exercise of stock options by our employees. Additional increases in billings may depend on a number of factors, including demand for and availability of our products and services, competition, pricing actions, market or industry changes, macroeconomic events such as rising inflation and interest rates, economic strength, supply chain capacity and disruptions, international conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and our ability to execute. We expect proceeds from the exercise of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units and performance stock units versus stock options granted to our employees and to vary based on our share price. We expect our cash tax payments to increase as a result of a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, other tax law changes and our expected growth.', 'As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments from continuing operations, in an aggregate amount of $5.1 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our material cash requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange volatility, elevated interest rates and global economic uncertainty have caused material disruptions in both U.S. and international financial markets and economies and are uncertain in duration. The impact of these events has increased, and may continue to increase, our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability.

See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements.\nFurthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter.

These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.\nThe table below summarizes our cash activity: \n2023\t\t2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\t$\t13,442 \t\t\t$\t10,811 \t\nNet cash used for investing activities\t$\t(5,495)\t\t\t$\t(2,430)\t\nNet cash used for financing activities\t$\t(3,009)\t\t\t$\t(8,523)', 'Sysco has certain customer contracts in which upfront monies are paid to its customers. These payments have become industry practice and are not related to financing of the customer’s business. They are not associated with any distinct good or service to be received from the customer and therefore, are treated as a reduction of transaction prices. All upfront payments are capitalized in other assets and amortized over the life of the contract or the expected life of the relationship with the customer on a straight-line basis. As of June 29, 2024, Sysco’s contract assets were not significant. We have no significant commissions paid that are directly attributable to obtaining a particular contract.', ""We continue to evaluate the possible effects of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts on operational cash flows, including the risks of declines in the overall freight market and our customers' liquidity and ability to pay. We regularly monitor working capital and maintain frequent communication with our customers, suppliers and service providers. A large portion of our cost structure is variable. Purchased transportation expense represents more than half of our total costs and is heavily tied to load volumes. Our second largest cost item is salaries and wages, the largest portion of which is driver pay, which includes a large variable component.\nOur senior notes consist of two separate issuances. The first is $250 million of 3.85% senior notes due March 2024, which was issued in March 2014. Interest payments under these notes are due semiannually in March and September of each year, beginning September 2014. The second is $700 million of 3.875% senior notes due March 2026, issued in March 2019. Interest payments under these notes are due semiannually in March and September of each year, beginning September 2019. We may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture.\n\n \n\nOur financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios."", 'Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow, cash on hand and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses (including capital expenditures), consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying dividends, funding restructuring activities and managing its capital structure on a short-term and long-term basis. In addition, as discussed in further detail above, the Company received approximately $2.6 billion of cash from the Veralto Distribution, a portion of which consideration the Company used to redeem certain of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe Company has relied primarily on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity provided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand, while also accessing the capital markets from time to time including to secure financing for more significant acquisitions. Subject to any limitations that may result from market disruptions (such as the disruptions in the financial and capital markets that occurred at times in 2020), the Company anticipates following the same approach in the future.', ""Liquidity, Sources and Uses of Capital: The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities.\n\nOperating Activities: Cash flows provided by operations were $1.191 billion in 2023 compared to cash used in operations of $1.460 billion in 2022. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by the Company's focus on reducing inventory, as evidenced by a decline of $1.123 billion in inventory in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, cash flows used in operations were $1.460 billion compared to cash provided by operations of $663.1 million in 2021. The year-over-year change was mainly attributable to lower accounts payable balances, lower earnings from continuing operations, and higher inventory balances. During the second half of 2020 and during 2021, the Company experienced higher than historical customer demand and increased supply chain constraints, resulting in historically high inventory levels in the first half of 2022 as consumer and DIY demand softened."", 'Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, cash proceeds generated from planned business divestitures and availability under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs, including our debt service requirements. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. See Note 9 for additional information.\nTransaction with Nutrition & Biosciences, Inc.\nOn February 1, 2021, the N&B Term Loan Facility was funded, which provided for a senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.250 billion, comprised of a $625 million three-year tranche (“2024 Term Loan Facility”) and a $625 million five-year tranche (“2026 Term Loan Facility”). Following the Merger, we assumed the indebtedness incurred by N&B in the debt financings, which included (i) the 2024 Term Loan Facility and 2026 Term Loan Facility and (ii) a series of Senior Notes in the aggregate amount of $6.250 billion with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. N&B’s indebtedness raised prior to the Merger was used to finance the Special Cash Payment (as defined below) to DuPont, which has been paid, and for the satisfaction of the related transaction fees and expenses. See Note 3 and Note 9 for additional information.\nIn connection with the N&B Transaction, a wholly owned subsidiary of IFF merged with and into N&B in exchange for 141,740,461 shares of IFF common stock, par value $0.125 per share (“IFF Common Stock”), which had been approved in the special shareholder meeting that occurred on August 27, 2020 where IFF shareholders voted to approve the issuance of shares of IFF common stock in connection with the N&B Transaction pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In connection with the N&B Transaction, DuPont received a one-time $7.359 billion special cash payment (the “Special Cash Payment”). The shares issued in the Merger represented approximately 55.4% of the common stock of IFF on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the Merger, as of February 1, 2021.

38,38,1d190416,Custom Hosp Analytics KPI impact on valuation for Intuitive Surgical.,"The provided data explains that the Custom Hospital Analytics program is intended to integrate various hospital data sources, enabling administrators, surgical chiefs, and surgeons to align their key performance indicators (KPIs), identify gaps, and set benchmarks for best practices. In essence, its effectiveness is assessed by the extent to which hospitals can analyze and improve their internal processes—for example, by reducing complication rates, shortening patient stays, and increasing surgical revenue. These improvements are indirect measures of program success, as they are tied to cost reductions and enhanced clinical outcomes.

Regarding the company’s valuation and investment appeal, the initiative supports a narrative that Intuitive Surgical’s technology not only drives clinical improvements but also enhances operational efficiency and financial performance at the hospital level. As hospitals experience improved outcomes and lower total costs per patient episode, they are more likely to adopt Intuitive’s products, potentially driving market share gains. This adoption, when coupled with data-driven decision making (e.g., improved KPIs and operational benchmarks), can lead to increased revenue streams and higher profitability for the company. Thus, while the reference does not provide quantitative metrics or specific financial ratios directly linking the Custom Hospital Analytics program to valuation, it qualitatively suggests that such initiatives build long-term investment appeal by reinforcing the company's competitive differentiators in cost efficiency and improved patient outcomes.","['We align our goals to those of our customers, often called the Quadruple Aim: enabling physicians and hospitals to improve outcomes for their patients, improve their patient’s and the care team’s experience, and lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. Through the use of Intuitive’s smart, connected systems, robotic technologies, advanced imaging, and informatics, our objective is to create value for patients, physicians, and hospitals, as summarized below.\nPatient Value. We believe that the value of a medical procedure to a patient can be defined: Patient Value = Procedure Efficacy / Invasiveness. We define procedure efficacy as a measure of the success of the procedure in helping resolve the underlying disease, and invasiveness as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. When the patient value of a procedure using an Intuitive product is greater than that of alternative intervention options, patients may benefit from seeking out physicians and hospitals that offer those products, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. Adoption of Intuitive technology occurs by procedure and by market and is driven by the relative patient value and the total intervention costs of da Vinci and Ion procedures as compared to alternative intervention options for the same disease state or condition. We believe that most patients will place a higher value on procedures that are not only more efficacious but also less invasive than alternative interventions. Our goal is to provide products to physicians who, in turn, provide patients with procedure options that are both highly effective and less invasive than others.\nPhysician Value. We offer physicians and their operating room staff training on the technical use of our products. Our da Vinci surgical system provides an ergonomic platform for surgeons to perform their procedures. We seek to provide surgeons with reliable and easy-to-use products. For example, the change to cloud-based analytics and routine use of local analytics may help surgeons track their procedures and processes and, with a network-connected smartphone and the My Intuitive app, surgeons can access and explore their procedure data, such as console time and instrument usage, to gain insights into their program. Ion brings physicians an immersive bronchoscopy experience from visualizing the lung anatomy and planning each patient’s procedure to navigating and biopsying small nodules in the peripheral lung. Results from early studies have demonstrated relatively low occurrence of pneumothorax requiring intervention.\nHospital Value. We help hospitals build value by increasing surgical revenue and reducing costs through lower complication rates and reduced lengths of patient stay. For example, we believe robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci surgical system is a cost-effective approach to many surgeries as compared to alternative treatment options, as recognized in many published studies. We also offer our Custom Hospital Analytics program, which enables the integration of data sources so that individual health institutions can analyze their data in their own environment. Usingthis data, administrators, chiefs of surgery, and surgeons can gain alignment around their programs based on their KPIs, determine best practices, assess gaps, and take actionable steps to address any gaps.']",,,FinDER,Non-numerical,"['We align our goals to those of our customers, often called the Quadruple Aim: enabling physicians and hospitals to improve outcomes for their patients, improve their patient’s and the care team’s experience, and lower the total cost to treat per patient episode.

Usingthis data, administrators, chiefs of surgery, and surgeons can gain alignment around their programs based on their KPIs, determine best practices, assess gaps, and take actionable steps to address any gaps.', 'INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\n\n\n \tYears Ended December 31,\n\n2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nRevenue:\t\t\t\t\t\nProduct\t$\t5,956.3 \t\t\t$\t5,198.0 \t\t\t$\t4,793.9 \t\nService\t1,167.8 \t\t\t1,024.2 \t\t\t916.2 \t\nTotal revenue\t7,124.1 \t\t\t6,222.2 \t\t\t5,710.1 \t\nCost of revenue:\t\t\t\t\t\nProduct\t2,041.8 \t\t\t1,700.3 \t\t\t1,464.1 \t\nService\t352.8 \t\t\t325.9 \t\t\t287.5 \t\nTotal cost of revenue\t2,394.6 \t\t\t2,026.2 \t\t\t1,751.6 \t\nGross profit\t4,729.5 \t\t\t4,196.0 \t\t\t3,958.5 \t\nOperating expenses:\t\t\t\t\t\nSelling, general and administrative\t1,963.9 \t\t\t1,739.9 \t\t\t1,466.5 \t\nResearch and development\t998.8 \t\t\t879.0 \t\t\t671.0 \t\nTotal operating expenses\t2,962.7 \t\t\t2,618.9 \t\t\t2,137.5 \t\nIncome from operations\t1,766.8 \t\t\t1,577.1 \t\t\t1,821.0 \t\nInterest and other income, net\t192.1 \t\t\t29.7 \t\t\t69.3 \t\nIncome before taxes\t1,958.9 \t\t\t1,606.8 \t\t\t1,890.3 \t\nIncome tax expense\t141.6 \t\t\t262.4 \t\t\t162.2 \t\nNet income\t1,817.3 \t\t\t1,344.4 \t\t\t1,728.1 \t\nLess: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture\t19.3 \t\t\t22.1 \t\t\t23.5 \t\nNet income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\t$\t1,798.0 \t\t\t$\t1,322.3 \t\t\t$\t1,704.6 \t\nNet income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc.:\t\t\t\t\t\nBasic\t$\t5.12 \t\t\t$\t3.72 \t\t\t$\t4.79 \t\nDiluted\t$\t5.03 \t\t\t$\t3.65 \t\t\t$\t4.66 \t\nShares used in computing net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc.:\t\t\t\t\t\nBasic\t351.2 \t\t\t355.7 \t\t\t356.1 \t\nDiluted\t357.4 \t\t\t362.0 \t\t\t365.8', 'INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PAR VALUE AMOUNTS)\n\nDecember 31,', 'We face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and other emerging diagnostic and interventional surgical approaches. Some of these procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and, in many cases, have a long history of use. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality, and reliability, as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with robotic-assisted medical procedures using da Vinci surgical systems or Ion endoluminal systems and their value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that have introduced or are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that the entrance or emergence of competition validates MIS and robotic-assisted surgery or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy.\nMoreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g., da Vinci Stapling and da Vinci Energy) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well-established companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic plc.\nAdditionally, we face or expect to face competition from companies that have developed or may develop wristed, robotic- or computer-assisted medical systems and products. The companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted medical procedures or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field include, but are not limited to, the following companies: Asensus Surgical, Inc.; Beijing Surgerii Robotics Company Limited; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson; Medicaroid Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; Noah Medical; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Shanghai Microport Medbot (Group) Co., Ltd.; and Shenzhen Edge Medical Co., Ltd. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of medical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics for medical procedures are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.

We provide products and services in China through our majority-owned joint venture (“Joint Venture”) with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (“Fosun Pharma”) and its affiliates. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further details on the Joint Venture. In the remainder of our markets outside of the U.S., we provide our products through distributors. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, domestic revenue accounted for 66%, 67%, and 67%, respectively, of total revenue, while revenue from our OUS markets accounted for 34%, 33%, and 33%, respectively, of total revenue.\nOur direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting the systems used in procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and healthcare facilities as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (“IDN groups”). The initial system sale into an account is a major capital equipment purchase by our customers and typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, the timing of budgeting cycles, and the evaluation of alternative products. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons or physicians and hospital staff across multiple specialties on the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci surgical system or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including the clinical benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci surgical system or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, in support of their Quadruple Aim objectives.\nOur clinical sales team works on site at hospitals, interacting with surgeons or physicians, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons or physicians who have an interest in robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy and the potential benefits provided by the da Vinci surgical system and the Ion endoluminal system. Our clinical sales team provides current clinical information on robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy practices and new product applications to the hospital teams. Our clinical sales team has grown with the expanded installed bases of da Vinci surgical systems and Ion endoluminal systems as well as the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands.\nOur customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. New direct customers who purchase a system typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories soon after they receive their system.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our sales of da Vinci surgical systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters. More than half of da Vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions. These benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer procedures and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. In the U.S., volumes for procedures associated with benign conditions are typically seasonally higher in the fourth quarter when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower in the first quarter when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside of the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instruments and accessories and capital purchases. As a result of factors outlined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” below, including the past and potential future recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns have been and may continue to be disrupted.\nCustomer Support\nWe have a network of field service and technical support engineers across the U.S., Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists, along with advanced service tools and solutions, offers a full complement of services for our customers, including installation, repair, maintenance, 24/7 technical support, and proactive system health monitoring. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs.', 'Our IKC revenues were impacted by an increase in shared savings from our VBC contracts and an increase in revenues from our special needs plans. Our U.S. other ancillary services revenues were impacted by increased revenues in our clinical research programs. Our international revenues increased due to acquisition-related growth as well as average reimbursement rate increases in certain countries.\nItems impacting operating income\nIKC adjustment. The increase in IKC revenues for 2023, as described above, was primarily due to the lifting of certain revenue recognition constraints for some of our value-based care contracts with health plans, allowing us to recognize approximately $55 million in incremental shared savings revenues.\nSeverance and other costs. During the fourth quarter of 2022, similar to U.S. dialysis, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions and other overhead costs. As a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our IKC business of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. By comparison, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our IKC business, and similar expenses and other charges in our international operations, of $0.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively.\nGoodwill impairment charge and related items. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $26.1 million in our transplant software business. We also recognized a gain of $7.7 million due to a reduction in the estimated value of earn-out obligations from our original acquisition of this business. This impairment charge and related gain resulted from a reduction in estimated fair value for the business driven primarily from the business not achieving its revenue targets, with reduced revenue expectations for future years, as well as an increase in the risk-free rate.\nOperating loss and adjusted operating loss:\nOur IKC operating loss was impacted by the IKC change in estimate, as described above. Our IKC operating loss and adjusted operating loss decreased primarily due to increased revenues, as described above, partially offset by continued investments in our integrated care support functions. Our U.S. other ancillary services operating loss was impacted by a goodwill impairment charge and related gain, as described above. Our U.S. other ancillary services operating loss and adjusted operating loss was impacted by improved performance in our clinical research programs. Our international operating income in 2022 was impacted by severance and other costs in one of our international businesses, as described above. International operating income and adjusted operating income were impacted by acquisition-related growth, partially offset by increases in equity losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency at our APAC JV and other direct operating expenses associated with our international dialysis centers.', 'We offer volume-based discounts, rebates, prompt pay discounts, right of return and other various incentives which we account for under the variable consideration model.  If sales incentives may be earned by a customer for purchasing a specified amount of our product, we estimate whether such incentives will be achieved and recognize these incentives as a reduction in revenue in the same period the underlying revenue transaction is recognized.  We primarily use the expected value method to estimate incentives.  Under the expected value method, we consider the historical experience of similar programs as well as review sales trends on a customer-by-customer basis to estimate what levels of incentives will be earned.  Occasionally, products are returned and, accordingly, we maintain an estimated refund liability based upon the expected value method that is recorded as a reduction in revenue.  \n\nWe analyze sales by two geographies, the United States and International; and by the following product categories: Knees; Hips; Sports Medicine, Extremities and Trauma (“S.E.T.”), which includes Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (“CMFT”); and Other.  Other includes sales from our Technology, Surgical and Bone Cement products.', 'During the 2022 period, we completed the sale of a 60% interest of Gentiva Hospice to CD&R for cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion, net of cash disposed, including debt repayments from Gentiva Hospice to Humana of $1.9 billion. In connection with the sale we recognized a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $237 million which was reported as a gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the 2023 period and 2022 period, we acquired various businesses for approximately $233 million and $337 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents received.\nDuring 2021, we acquired Kindred at Home and other primary care businesses for cash consideration of approximately $4.2 billion, net of cash received.\nOur ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our primary care operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. Net capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $794 million, $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in the 2023, 2022 and 2021 periods, respectively. Net purchases of investment securities were $2.5 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.1 billion in the 2023, 2022 and 2021 periods, respectively.', 'Segment operating income increased $398 million (29.0%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping a prior year intangible asset impairment charge, the impact of acquisitions and the impact of divestitures. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher manufacturing costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (including lapping a prior year benefit from contingent consideration adjustments), higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, fixed asset impairment charges incurred in 2022, inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022, unfavorable volume/mix, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.']",939.333333983086,"By giving hospital administrators and surgeons real-time visibility into KPI trends—such as complication rates, length-of-stay and instrument utilization—Custom Hospital Analytics helps them standardize best practices, cut costs and raise procedure volumes; this, in turn, drives higher da Vinci system usage and follow-on instrument and service revenue (which already rose 14 % year-over-year to 1.17 billion in 2023). The resulting uptick in recurring, high-margin service revenue and stickier customer relationships supports Intuitive Surgical’s mid-teens topline growth, reinforces its competitive moat and lifts the multiple the market is willing to pay, thereby enhancing the company’s overall valuation."

When compared to the cash and cash equivalents balance of $5.2 billion, the contractual outflows represent roughly 2.8% of available cash (i.e., $148 million is about 2.8% of $5.2 billion), indicating that the company's near-term cash obligations are very small relative to its cash position.","['We at CoStar believe the balance of cash and cash equivalents, which was $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired two apartment communities, and closed on the pre-purchase of a multifamily development community. The increase in cash outflows for capital improvements and other was primarily driven by increased capital spend relating to our revenue enhancing capital expenditures and recurring capital replacements, partially offset by decreased property redevelopment and repositioning activities and decreased reconstruction-related capital expenditures relating to winter storms during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash outflows for development costs was driven by increased development spend during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash outflows for contributions to affiliates was driven by a larger amount of investments made in the technology-focused limited partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash inflows from proceeds from real estate asset dispositions resulted from the disposition of one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the disposition of four multifamily communities and two land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2022.

41,41,32dae464,Impact on risk mitigation and capital allocation from NSC's third-party compliance.,"The measures described—particularly requiring third-party vendors to comply with detailed security protocols, including the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, as well as contractual obligations regarding incident reporting—directly mitigate financial risks in several ways. First, by ensuring that all vendors who handle sensitive data adhere to strict security standards, the company minimizes the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, or security incidents originating from third parties. This risk reduction helps protect against potential financial losses from remediation costs, regulatory fines, litigation, and reputational damage. Second, comprehensive vendor oversight and mandated incident reporting make it easier for the company to quickly identify and address security issues, thereby reducing the duration and severity of any breach which in turn limits the financial impact.

In terms of how these controls might affect future capital allocation decisions, the improved risk profile can lead to more efficient deployment of capital. With a lower probability of costly cyber incidents, the company may experience reduced insurance premiums and lower required reserves for cybersecurity risk. This potentially frees up capital that can be reinvested into growth opportunities, such as operational improvements or strategic investments in technology infrastructure. Additionally, a robust cybersecurity framework and diligent third-party oversight can make the company more attractive to investors and creditors, potentially lowering the cost of capital and enabling a more favorable capital allocation strategy in the future.

Overall, by mitigating financial risks related to cybersecurity threats through stringent third-party vendor management, the company not only protects its current financial condition but also strengthens its ability to allocate capital toward value-generating initiatives.","[""CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\n\nProcess\n\nWe use a multi-layered defensive cybersecurity strategy based on the cyber security framework drafted by the NIST. The NIST CSF is a voluntary framework of best practices to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity matters. Based on the NIST CSF, our processes to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats includes the following:\n\nIdentify\nWe identify risks from cybersecurity threats by first developing and maintaining an understanding of those assets essential to our operation and reputation, as well as assets that could provide value to threat actors. Any cyber act is considered a potential risk if a threat actor can use it to reduce the value of an asset, reduce our ability to utilize or otherwise access the value of an asset, or surreptitiously gain or increase their access to an asset or its value.\n\nAssess\nWe assess risks from cybersecurity threats by evaluating exposure of our assets to identified cyber risks, as well as potential impacts to our operations or reputation from our inability to access or utilize an asset or realize its value, or a threat actor’s ability to gain access to an asset or its value. We further evaluate the potential materiality of these risks based on the potential impact to our operations or reputation.\n\nManage\nWe mitigate risks from cybersecurity threats by applying multiple layers of defense to ensure we have the continued ability to access or utilize an asset or its value, and deny threat actors the ability to gain or increase their access to an asset or its value. We prioritize defensive mechanisms, including administrative,\nprocedural, and technical controls, according to their relative cost and reduction in risk based on the NIST CSF.\n\nWe further monitor, test, assess, and update these processes, including working with government agencies and peers to implement practices to guard against an evolving threat environment and to ensure we remain compliant with relevant regulatory requirements.\n\nIntegration into our Risk Management Framework\n\nOur processes to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks are expressly incorporated into our enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, which includes technology as one of the five primary risk categories addressed by the ERM framework, with cybersecurity risks being one of the three subcategories within the technology risk category. As a result, our ERM leadership team works with the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to define the top areas of risk in both the technology and cybersecurity areas, with such risks incorporated into our ERM framework and mapped to the NIST CSF. Our internal ERM leadership also meets on a quarterly basis with our technology risk working group, comprised of leaders across the information technology, information security and law departments, to monitor developments in the threat landscape so that key cybersecurity threats impacting the Company continue to be identified and prioritized.\n\nThird-Party Engagement\n\nWe employ multiple service providers from time to time to perform periodic reviews and evaluations of our cybersecurity framework, the results of which are provided to and reviewed with management, with appropriate reporting to the Finance and Risk Management Committee (F&RM Committee) of the Board. These reviews encompass a broad range of areas, including information technology system resilience, cybersecurity risk assessments, information security program assessments, external threat environment reviews, internal cybersecurity policy compliance, and near-term incident response to identify or disconfirm potential involvement of a threat actor.\n\nOversight of Third-Party Providers\n\nWithin our purchasing and third-party vendor management programs, we require all vendors who handle our data as well as vendors who provide technology and data services – including hardware, software, staffing, and support – to maintain certain security protections including, but not limited to, compliance with applicable data protection laws, and implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect our data, including how our data is stored, accessed and transmitted.

42,42,4ac64515,"Valuation, strategic impact of share repurchases, and Pentair EPS.","The share repurchase program outlined in the data has several potential impacts on Pentair plc’s earnings per share (EPS) and overall market valuation. First, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, the repurchase can increase EPS, assuming net income remains the same. That is because when fewer shares are available, the same level of earnings is divided among a smaller base, enhancing the per‐share performance metrics. This is an important consideration for investors evaluating profitability on a per-share basis.

In addition, such buybacks can send a positive signal to the market. They may indicate that management believes the company’s shares are undervalued and that returning capital to shareholders is a superior alternative compared to other investment options. This signal can enhance investor confidence and potentially improve market valuation. The disclosure of $600 million remaining under the repurchase authorization demonstrates that Pentair plc is maintaining flexibility in its capital allocation strategy. It shows that aside from regular earnings reinvestment and growth strategies, the company is also focused on balancing returning value to shareholders while managing dilution from equity incentive programs (i.e., shares surrendered due to option exercises and vesting of restricted/performance shares).

Moreover, the repurchases align with a broader financial strategy typically involving judicious capital allocation. By combining repurchases from publicly announced plans with share reductions via equity incentive programs, Pentair plc not only supports EPS improvement but also maintains the balance between growth initiatives and shareholder returns. In summary, the potential impact will be a boosted EPS because of a reduced share count, potentially improved market sentiment, and a clear commitment to employing excess cash in a manner that optimizes shareholder value over time.","['The following table provides information with respect to purchases we at Pentair made of our ordinary shares during the fourth quarter of 2023:\n(a)\t(b)\t(c)\t(d)\nTotal number \nof shares\npurchased\tAverage \nprice paid \nper share\tTotal number \nof shares purchased as part of publicly\nannounced plans\nor programs\tDollar value of\nshares that may\nyet be purchased\nunder the plans \nor programs\nOctober 1 – October 28\n4,679 \t\t$\t63.56 \t\t— \t\t$\t600,002,203 \t\nOctober 29 – November 25\n594 \t\t60.99 \t\t— \t\t600,002,203 \t\nNovember 26 – December 31\n1,283 \t\t65.23 \t\t— \t\t600,002,203 \t\nTotal\t6,556 \t\t\t— \t\t\n \n(a)The purchases in this column include 4,679 shares for the period October 1 – October 28, 594 shares for the period October 29 – November 25, and 1,283 shares for the period November 26 – December 31 deemed surrendered to us by participants in our equity incentive plans to satisfy the exercise price or withholding of tax obligations related to the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted and performance shares.\n(b)The average price paid in this column includes shares repurchased as part of our publicly announced plans and shares deemed surrendered to us by participants in our equity incentive plans to satisfy the exercise price for the exercise price of stock options and withholding tax obligations due upon stock option exercises and vesting of restricted and performance shares.\n(c)The number of shares in this column represents the number of shares repurchased as part of our publicly announced plans to repurchase our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit authorized by the Board of Directors, discussed below.\n(d)In December 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of $750.0 million.

44,44,99c5660d,"Operating margins for Arista from 2021-2023 show impressive efficiency, ARISTA.","To calculate the operating margin for each year, we use the formula: Operating Margin = (Income from Operations / Total Revenue) × 100.

• For 2023: Operating Margin = (2,257,249 / 5,860,168) × 100 ≈ 38.5%
• For 2022: Operating Margin = (1,527,106 / 4,381,310) × 100 ≈ 34.9%
• For 2021: Operating Margin = (924,739 / 2,948,037) × 100 ≈ 31.4%

These calculations show a year-over-year improvement: the operating margin increased from roughly 31.4% in 2021 to 38.5% in 2023. This upward trend suggests that Arista Networks, Inc. has enhanced its operating efficiency, either through improved cost management or increased revenue generation (or both). The increment in the operating margin indicates that the company is generating a higher profit from its operations relative to its sales, which is a positive sign of its operational performance.","['ARISTA NETWORKS, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nYear Ended December

45,45,eeda4426,TDY EPS trend analysis adj for WAS & implications on SH value.,"Over the three years, Teledyne's basic and diluted EPS have increased significantly despite modest increases in weighted average common shares outstanding. In 2021, the basic EPS was $10.31 (with 43.2 million shares) and diluted EPS was $10.05 (with 44.3 million shares). In 2022, these figures rose to $16.85 (46.8 million shares) for basic EPS and $16.53 (47.7 million shares) for diluted EPS. By 2023, basic EPS further increased to $18.80 (47.1 million shares) and diluted EPS to $18.49 (47.9 million shares).

To put this into perspective, while the number of shares outstanding increased by roughly 9-10% over the period, the basic EPS grew from $10.31 to $18.80 – an increase of about 82%. This disparity indicates that the company’s net income growth has outpaced the increase in shares, suggesting robust improvements in profitability on a per-share basis. In other words, shareholders have seen enhanced value creation as the earnings generated per share – a key measure of profitability – have risen considerably, implying effective capital allocation and operational performance over the three-year period.","['TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in millions, except per-share amounts) \n  \nFor the Fiscal Year\n \t\t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nNet sales\t\t$\t5,635.5 \t\t\t$\t5,458.6 \t\t\t$\t4,614.3 \t\nCosts and expenses\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCost of sales\t\t3,196.1 \t\t\t3,128.3 \t\t\t2,772.9 \t\nSelling, general and administrative\t\t1,208.3 \t\t\t1,156.6 \t\t\t1,067.8 \t\nAcquired intangible asset amortization\t\t196.7 \t\t\t201.7 \t\t\t149.3 \t\nTotal costs and expenses\t\t4,601.1 \t\t\t4,486.6 \t\t\t3,990.0 \t\nOperating income (loss)\n1,034.4 \t\t\t972.0 \t\t\t624.3 \t\nInterest and debt expense, net\t\t(77.3)\t\t\t(89.3)\t\t\t(90.8)\t\nNon-service retirement benefit income\t\t12.4 \t\t\t11.4 \t\t\t11.2 \t\nGain (loss) on debt extinguishment\t\t1.6 \t\t\t10.6 \t\t\t(13.4)\t\nOther income (expense), net\t\t(12.2)\t\t\t3.4 \t\t\t2.5 \t\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n958.9 \t\t\t908.1 \t\t\t533.8 \t\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\t\t72.3 \t\t\t119.2 \t\t\t88.5 \t\nNet income (loss) including noncontrolling interest\n886.6 \t\t\t788.9 \t\t\t445.3 \t\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest\t\t0.9 \t\t\t0.3 \t\t\t— \t\nNet income (loss) attributable to Teledyne\t\t$\t885.7 \t\t\t$\t788.6 \t\t\t$\t445.3 \t\nBasic earnings per common share\t\t$\t18.80 \t\t\t$\t16.85 \t\t\t$\t10.31 \t\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\t\t47.1 \t\t\t46.8 \t\t\t43.2 \t\nDiluted earnings per common share\t\t$\t18.49 \t\t\t$\t16.53 \t\t\t$\t10.05 \t\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding\t\t47.9 \t\t\t47.7 \t\t\t44.3']",,Compositional,FinDER,Compositional,"['TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in millions, except per-share amounts) \n  \nFor the Fiscal Year\n \t\t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nNet sales\t\t$\t5,635.5 \t\t\t$\t5,458.6 \t\t\t$\t4,614.3 \t\nCosts and expenses\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCost of sales\t\t3,196.1 \t\t\t3,128.3 \t\t\t2,772.9 \t\nSelling, general and administrative\t\t1,208.3 \t\t\t1,156.6 \t\t\t1,067.8 \t\nAcquired intangible asset amortization\t\t196.7 \t\t\t201.7 \t\t\t149.3 \t\nTotal costs and expenses\t\t4,601.1 \t\t\t4,486.6 \t\t\t3,990.0 \t\nOperating income (loss)\n1,034.4 \t\t\t972.0 \t\t\t624.3 \t\nInterest and debt expense, net\t\t(77.3)\t\t\t(89.3)\t\t\t(90.8)\t\nNon-service retirement benefit income\t\t12.4 \t\t\t11.4 \t\t\t11.2 \t\nGain (loss) on debt extinguishment\t\t1.6 \t\t\t10.6 \t\t\t(13.4)\t\nOther income (expense), net\t\t(12.2)\t\t\t3.4 \t\t\t2.5 \t\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n958.9 \t\t\t908.1 \t\t\t533.8 \t\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\t\t72.3 \t\t\t119.2 \t\t\t88.5 \t\nNet income (loss) including noncontrolling interest\n886.6 \t\t\t788.9 \t\t\t445.3 \t\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest\t\t0.9 \t\t\t0.3 \t\t\t— \t\nNet income (loss) attributable to Teledyne\t\t$\t885.7 \t\t\t$\t788.6 \t\t\t$\t445.3 \t\nBasic earnings per common share\t\t$\t18.80 \t\t\t$\t16.85 \t\t\t$\t10.31 \t\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\t\t47.1 \t\t\t46.8 \t\t\t43.2 \t\nDiluted earnings per common share\t\t$\t18.49 \t\t\t$\t16.53 \t\t\t$\t10.05 \t\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding\t\t47.9 \t\t\t47.7 \t\t\t44.3']",eeda4426,True,"['The table below details the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (""EPS""):\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\t2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\nNumerator\t\t\t\t\t\nNet income from continuing operations\t$3,842.1 \t\t\t$2,292.8 \t\t\t$2,243.5 \t\nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations\t(13.9)\t\t\t7.4 \t\t\t12.6 \t\nNet Income attributable to Air Products\t$3,828.2 \t\t\t$2,300.2 \t\t\t$2,256.1 \t\nDenominator (in millions)\nWeighted average common shares — Basic\t222.5 \t\t\t222.3 \t\t\t222.0 \t\nEffect of dilutive securities\t\t\t\t\t\nEmployee stock option and other award plans\t0.3 \t\t\t0.4 \t\t\t0.5 \t\nWeighted average common shares — Diluted\t222.8 \t\t\t222.7 \t\t\t222.5 \t\nPer Share Data(A) (U.S. Dollars per share)\nBasic EPS from continuing operations\t$17.27 \t\t\t$10.31 \t\t\t$10.11 \t\nBasic EPS from discontinued operations\t(0.06)\t\t\t0.03 \t\t\t0.06 \t\nBasic EPS attributable to Air Products\t$17.21 \t\t\t$10.35 \t\t\t$10.16 \t\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations\t$17.24 \t\t\t$10.30 \t\t\t$10.08 \t\nDiluted EPS from discontinued operations\t(0.06)\t\t\t0.03 \t\t\t0.06 \t\nDiluted EPS attributable to Air Products\t$17.18 \t\t\t$10.33 \t\t\t$10.14 \t\n \n(A)EPS is calculated independently for each component and may not sum to total EPS due to rounding.\nDiluted EPS attributable to Air Products reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other share-based awards were exercised or converted into common stock.

acquisitions (14.0 pp) and favorable volume/mix (3.8 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (10.0 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.9 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina as well as Brazil and Mexico. The November 1, 2022 acquisition of Ricolino added incremental net revenues of $507 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2023. Favorable volume/mix reflected strong volume growth as the region continued to see increased demand for most of our snack category products. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in gum, biscuits & baked snacks, candy and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages and chocolate. Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Mexican peso and Brazilian real.

49,49,f4d9cb7d,2024-29 CRC liquidity financing impact from NSC contractual cash outflows.,"The data provided shows a clear schedule of contractual obligations – estimated cash outflows in millions of dollars by period – which allows us to assess both near‐term and longer-term cash requirements. In 2024, Norfolk Southern faces approximately $42.6 billion in contractual payments. Although the amounts scheduled in 2025 through 2027 are smaller (roughly $3.3 billion, $3.4 billion, and $2.9 billion, respectively), there is also an additional $33.0 billion of obligations scheduled for 2029 and subsequent years. These figures indicate a high concentration of near-term cash outflows that could strain short-term liquidity if not managed with adequate working capital or liquidity reserves.

Short-term liquidity implications include the need to ensure that sufficient cash or easily liquidated assets are available to cover the large 2024 outlay. This might compel the company to either manage operating cash flows tightly or secure short-term financing facilities to bridge any liquidity gaps. In contrast, the long-term financing strategy will have to address the sizable outflow commitments that lie in 2029 and beyond. This forward-planning might include refinancing existing obligations, locking in fixed-rate financing for longer periods, or using long-term capital instruments. More generally, the distribution of obligations suggests a need for a dual-strategy: one focused on immediate liquidity management for the large 2024 payment and another oriented towards sustaining the firm’s credit profile and managing refinancing risk over the longer term.

Our credit agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”), which as of January 31, 2024, provides the ability to borrow up to $3.0 billion in unsecured financing (the “Credit Facility”), also serves as a source of liquidity.\nCash from operations could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which are not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt maintenance needs over the next 12 months.\nIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.\nThe net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2024 was primarily related to capital expenditures of $736 million, net outflows from strategic investment activity of $388 million, and net outflows related to marketable securities activity of $121 million. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2023 was primarily related to capital expenditures of $798 million, net outflows of $557 million from marketable securities activity, cash consideration for acquisitions of approximately $439 million and net outflows of $195 million from strategic investment activity.', 'We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict.

We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A.

As of June 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under its revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any noncompliance with such covenants.\nThe principal uses of cash that affect the Company’s liquidity position include the following: the acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including production costs; marketing and promotional expenses; expenses related to broadcasting the Company’s programming; employee and facility costs; capital expenditures; acquisitions; income taxes, interest and dividend payments; debt repayments; legal settlements; and stock repurchases.\nIn addition to the transactions disclosed within Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals, and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets.

Future interest payments on our debt total $716.7 million, of which $155.4 million is payable in 2024.\n•The liability for our operating and finance lease payments is $1,492.5 million, of which $309.3 million is due in 2024.\n•The obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is $224.3 million, and the liability for our postemployment arrangements is $142.2 million. In 2023, we contributed $8.8 million to our defined benefit plans and paid $10.9 million for our postemployment arrangements.

The exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition programs, and our ground lease purchase program.', 'Amortization\n\n \n\n$\n\n96.7\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n35.4\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n9.4\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n5.1\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n146.6\n\n \n\nDepreciation\n\n \n\n$\n\n12.8\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n15.3\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n2.7\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n1.6\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n6.8\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n39.2\n\n \n\nInterest expense\n\n \n\n$\n\n94.3\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n33.0\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n12.9\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n2.1\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n(1.1\n\n)\n\n \n\n$\n\n141.2\n\n \n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n \n\n$\n\n466.7\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n271.1\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n117.7\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n24.1\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n(3.5\n\n)\n\n \n\n$\n\n876.1\n\n \n\nTotal assets\n\n \n\n$\n\n7,458.6\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n4,467.8\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n1,401.6\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n295.0\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n350.5\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n13,973.5\n\n \n\nCapital expenditures\n\n \n\n$\n\n18.6\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n20.2\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n2.8\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n1.0\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n10.0\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n52.6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\n\n \n\n(in millions)\n\n \n\nRetail\n\n \n\n \n\nNational\nPrograms\n\n \n\n \n\nWholesale\nBrokerage\n\n \n\n \n\nServices\n\n \n\n \n\nOther\n\n \n\n \n\nTotal\n\n \n\nTotal revenues\n\n \n\n$\n\n1,767.9\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n701.9\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n403.4\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n178.9\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n(0.7\n\n)\n\n \n\n$\n\n3,051.4\n\n \n\nInvestment income\n\n \n\n$\n\n0.3\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n0.6\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n0.2\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n1.1\n\n \n\nAmortization\n\n \n\n$\n\n77.8\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n27.4\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n9.1\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n5.3\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n119.6\n\n \n\nDepreciation\n\n \n\n$\n\n11.2\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n9.8\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n2.6\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n1.5\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n8.2\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n33.3\n\n \n\nInterest expense\n\n \n\n$\n\n91.4\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n11.4\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n16.0\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n2.9\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n(56.7\n\n)\n\n \n\n$\n\n65.0\n\n \n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n \n\n$\n\n334.4\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n242.3\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n94.8\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n28.3\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n63.0\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n762.8\n\n \n\nTotal assets\n\n \n\n$\n\n5,040.7', '(In millions of dollars)\tYears Ending December 31,\t\t\nMaterial Cash Requirements\t2024\t\t2025\t\t2026\t\t2027\t\t2028\t\tThereafter\t\tTotals\nDebt and other long-term obligations(a)\n$\t835 \t\t\t$\t599 \t\t\t$\t2,777 \t\t\t$\t3,918 \t\t\t$\t2,628 \t\t\t$\t12,335 \t\t\t$\t23,092 \t\nInterest payments on debt and other long-term obligations(b)(c)\n873 \t\t\t850 \t\t\t815 \t\t\t705 \t\t\t581 \t\t\t5,642 \t\t\t9,466 \t\nLease obligations(d)\n570 \t\t\t557 \t\t\t548 \t\t\t542 \t\t\t540 \t\t\t5,472 \t\t\t8,229 \t\nTotal material cash requirements\t$\t2,278 \t\t\t$\t2,006 \t\t\t$\t4,140 \t\t\t$\t5,165 \t\t\t$\t3,749 \t\t\t$\t23,449 \t\t\t$\t40,787 \t\n \n(a)The impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 (collectively, ""Tower Revenue Notes"") is not considered. The Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 have principal amounts of $700 million and $750 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2025 and 2028, respectively. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our definition of and additional information regarding the Tower Revenue Notes.\n(b)If the Tower Revenue Notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable Tower Revenue Notes) of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2045 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The full year 2023 Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes was approximately $993 million. We currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.\n(c)Includes the unused commitment fees on our 2016 Credit Facility. Interest payments on the variable rate debt are based on estimated rates currently in effect. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding potential upward or downward adjustments to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility if we achieve specified annual sustainability targets or fail to meet annual sustainability thresholds. Each annual period presented assumes the downward adjustments in the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility. See ""Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"" for a discussion of our interest rate risk.\n(d)Amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land on which our towers are located and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods exercisable at our option that are reasonably certain to be exercised and excludes our contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) as such arrangements are excluded from our operating lease liability.

These outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of one operating property for approximately $70.5 million in 2022.

The increase in cash outflows for development costs was driven by increased development spend during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash outflows for contributions to affiliates was driven by a larger amount of investments made in the technology-focused limited partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash inflows from proceeds from real estate asset dispositions resulted from the disposition of one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the disposition of four multifamily communities and two land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2022.

55,55,b13b4f10,"Impact of MAR variable rev recognition on incentive mgmt & franchise fees perf revs, ticker.","Marriott recognizes its variable revenue streams for both incentive management fees and franchise royalty fees on a monthly basis as the related performance obligations are satisfied. For incentive management fees, the company calculates the fees based on a percentage of each hotel’s profitability for that month and recognizes the revenue as long as there is no expectation of a meaningful reversal in future periods—meaning that if future hotel performance or cash flows are expected to deteriorate, prompting significant reversals, Marriott would adjust its revenue recognition accordingly. Similarly, the ongoing franchise royalty fees are determined as a percentage of specific revenues from the franchised properties and are recognized monthly as the amounts become payable. In both cases, since the fees are based on variable, performance‐dependent metrics, any projection of future performance issues that could lead to a reversal of previously recognized revenue would impact how much revenue is ultimately reported; if Marriott anticipates that future hotel performance will fall short of earlier estimates, it may delay or reverse some of the recognized revenue to reflect more realistic future outcomes.","['Base Management and Incentive Management Fees: For our managed properties, we have performance obligations to provide hotel management services and a license to our intellectual property for the use of our brand names. As compensation for such services, we are generally entitled to receive base fees, which are a percentage of the revenues of properties, and incentive management fees, which are generally based on a measure of hotel profitability. Both the base and incentive management fees are variable consideration, as the transaction price is based on a percentage of revenue or profit, as defined in each contract. We recognize base management fees on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement as those amounts become payable. We recognize incentive management fees on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement based on each property’s financial results, as long as we do not expect a significant reversal due to projected future hotel performance or cash flows in future periods.\nFranchise Fee and Royalty Fee Revenue: For our franchised properties, we have a performance obligation to provide franchisees and operators a license to our intellectual property for use of certain of our brand names. As compensation for such services, we are typically entitled to initial application fees and ongoing royalty fees. Our ongoing royalty fees represent variable consideration, as the transaction price is based on a percentage of certain revenues of the properties, as defined in each contract. We recognize royalty fees on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement as those amounts become payable. Initial application and relicensing fees are fixed consideration payable upon submission of a franchise application or renewal and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial or renewal term of the franchise agreements.\nOwned and Leased Hotel Revenue: At our owned and leased hotels, we have performance obligations to provide accommodations and other ancillary services to hotel guests. As compensation for such goods and services, we are typically entitled to a fixed nightly fee for an agreed upon period and additional fixed fees for any ancillary services purchased. These fees are generally payable at the time the hotel guest checks out of the hotel. We generally satisfy the performance obligations over time, and we recognize the revenue from room sales and from other ancillary guest services on a daily basis, as the rooms are occupied and we have rendered the services.\nCost Reimbursements: Under our management and franchise agreements, we are entitled to be reimbursed for certain costs we incur on behalf of the managed, franchised, and licensed properties, with no added mark-up. These costs primarily consist of payroll and related expenses at managed properties where we are the employer of the employees at the properties and include certain operational and administrative costs as provided for in our contracts with the owners. We are entitled to reimbursement in the period we incur the related reimbursable costs, which we recognize within the “Cost reimbursement revenue” caption of our Income Statements. Under our management and franchise agreements, hotel owners and franchisees participate in certain centralized programs and services, such as marketing, sales, reservations, and insurance programs. We operate these programs and services for the benefit of our hotel owners. We do not operate these programs and services to generate a profit over the long term, and accordingly, when we recover the costs that we incur for these programs and services from our hotel owners, we do not seek a mark-up. The amounts we charge for these programs and services are generally a combination of fixed fees and variable fees based on sales or other metrics and are payable on a monthly basis. We generally recognize revenue within the “Cost reimbursement revenue” caption of our Income Statements when the amounts may be billed to hotel owners, and we recognize expenses within the “Reimbursed expenses” caption as they are incurred. This pattern of recognition results in timing differences between the costs incurred for centralized programs and services and the related reimbursement from hotel owners in our operating and net income. Over the long term, these programs and services are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. In addition, we present in the “Reimbursed expenses” caption of our Income Statements spending funded by the proceeds ($664 million, $425 million after-tax) from the 2017 sale of our interest in Avendra LLC, which we committed would be used for the benefit of hotels in our system. Such spending totaled $161 million ($120 million after-tax) in 2023, $69 million ($52 million after-tax) in 2022, and $56 million ($42 million after-tax) in 2021.\nOther Revenue: Includes Global Design fees, which we describe below, termination fees, and other property and brand revenues. We generally recognize termination fees when collection is probable and other revenue as services are rendered. Amounts received in advance are deferred as liabilities.\nWe provide certain hotel design and construction review (“Global Design”) services to our managed and franchised hotel owners, generally during the period prior to a hotel’s opening or during the period a hotel is converting to a Marriott brand (the “pre-opening period”). As compensation for such services, we may be entitled to receive a fixed fee that is payable during the pre-opening period of the hotel. As these services are not a distinct performance obligation, we recognize the fees on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the management or franchise agreement within the “Owned, leased, and other revenue” caption of our Income Statements.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions: We do not disclose the amount of variable consideration that we expect to recognize in future periods in the following circumstances:\n(1) if we recognize the revenue based on the amount invoiced or services performed;\n(2) for sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property; or\n(3) if the consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation, and the terms of the consideration relate specifically to our efforts to transfer, or to a specific outcome from transferring the service.\nWe are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of governmental agencies and remit these to the applicable governmental agencies on a periodic basis. We do not include these taxes in determining the transaction price.\nLoyalty Program: Loyalty Program members earn points based on the money they spend at our properties; the exchange of timeshare ownership interests; purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products; and through participation in travel experiences and affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by credit card, car rental, airline, and other companies. Members can redeem points for stays at most of our properties, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, merchandise, and a variety of other awards. Points cannot be redeemed for cash.\nUnder our Loyalty Program, we have a performance obligation to provide or arrange for the provision of goods or services for free or at a discount to Loyalty Program members in exchange for the redemption of points earned from past activities. We operate our Loyalty Program as a cross-brand marketing program to participating properties. Our management and franchise agreements require that properties reimburse us for a portion of the costs of operating the Loyalty Program, with no added mark-up, including costs related to the following activities, which we expense as incurred in our “Reimbursed expenses” caption of our Income Statements: marketing, promotion, and communications and services provided to Loyalty Program members. We generally receive monthly cash contributions from managed, franchised, owned, and leased properties based on a portion of qualified spend by Loyalty Program members (when the points are earned). We recognize these contributions into revenue as we provide the related service (when the points are redeemed). The amount of revenue we recognize upon point redemption is based on a blend of historical funding rates and is impacted by our estimate of the “breakage” for points that members will never redeem. We estimate breakage based on our historical experience and expectations of future member behavior. We recognize revenue net of the redemption cost within our “Cost reimbursement revenue” caption on our Income Statements, as our performance obligation is to facilitate the transaction between the Loyalty Program member and the managed or franchised property or program partner. Our redemption cost, which is generally based on redemption rates that can increase in periods in which occupancy at the property exceeds a certain threshold, could be higher or lower than our revenue recognized in any given period. We have multi-year agreements for our co-branded credit cards associated with our Loyalty Program. Under these agreements, we have performance obligations to provide a license to the intellectual property associated with our brands and marketing lists (“Licensed IP”) to the financial institutions that issue the credit cards, to arrange for the redemption of Loyalty Program points as discussed in the preceding paragraph, and to arrange for the redemption of free night certificates and gift cards provided to cardholders. We receive fees from these agreements, including fixed amounts that are primarily payable at contract inception, and variable amounts that are paid to us monthly over the term of the agreements, generally based on: (1) the number of free night certificates issued or redeemed; (2) the number of Loyalty Program points purchased; (3) the volume of cardholder spend; and (4) the number of gift cards issued. We allocate those fees among the performance obligations, including the Licensed IP, our Loyalty Program points, free night certificates, and gift cards provided to cardholders based on their estimated standalone selling prices. The estimation of the standalone selling prices requires significant judgments based upon generally accepted valuation methodologies regarding the value of our Licensed IP, the amount of funding we will receive, and the number of Loyalty Program points, free night certificates, and gift cards cardholders will ultimately redeem. We base our estimates of these amounts on our historical experience and expectation of future cardholder behavior. We recognize the portion of the Licensed IP revenue that meets the sales-based royalty criteria as the credit cards are used and the remaining portion of the Licensed IP revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract term. In our Income Statements, we primarily recognize Licensed IP revenue in the “Franchise fees” caption, and we recognize a portion in the “Cost reimbursement revenue” caption. We recognize the revenue related to the Loyalty Program points as discussed in the preceding paragraph. We recognize the revenue related to the free night certificates and gift cards when the related service is provided. We recognize revenue net of the redemption cost, as our performance obligation is to facilitate the transaction between the Loyalty Program member and the managed or franchised property.\nContract Balances: We generally receive payments from customers as we satisfy our performance obligations. We record a receivable when we have an unconditional right to receive payment and only the passage of time is required before payment is due. We record deferred revenue when we receive payment, or have the unconditional right to receive payment, in advance of the satisfaction of our performance obligations related to franchise application and relicensing fees, Global Design fees, credit card branding license fees, and our Loyalty Program.\nOur current and noncurrent deferred revenue decreased by $108 million, to $1,223 million at December 31, 2023, from $1,331 million at December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of $274 million of revenue recognized in 2023 that was deferred as of December 31, 2022, as well as the reclassification from deferred revenue to the liability for guest loyalty program, which we discuss below. The decrease was partially offset by revenue deferred in 2023 related to our gift cards, co-branded credit cards, franchise application and relicensing fees, and certain centralized programs and services fees.\nOur current and noncurrent liability for guest loyalty program increased by $412 million, to $7,006 million at December 31, 2023, from $6,594 million at December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in points earned by members. This includes a $112 million reclassification from deferred revenue to the liability for guest loyalty program primarily due to points that were earned during the period by members using our U.S.-issued co-branded credit cards, which were prepaid by the financial institutions in 2020. The increase was partially offset by $2,798 million of revenue recognized in 2023, that was deferred as of December 31, 2022. At each reporting period, we evaluate the estimates used in the recognition of Loyalty Program revenues, including estimates of the breakage of points that members will never redeem and the amount of funding we expect to receive over the life of the agreements with various third parties. In 2023, the updated estimates resulted in a net decrease in revenue, and a corresponding increase in the liability for guest loyalty program of approximately $148 million.']",,,FinDER,Non-numerical,"['Base Management and Incentive Management Fees: For our managed properties, we have performance obligations to provide hotel management services and a license to our intellectual property for the use of our brand names. As compensation for such services, we are generally entitled to receive base fees, which are a percentage of the revenues of properties, and incentive management fees, which are generally based on a measure of hotel profitability. Both the base and incentive management fees are variable consideration, as the transaction price is based on a percentage of revenue or profit, as defined in each contract. We recognize base management fees on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement as those amounts become payable. We recognize incentive management fees on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement based on each property’s financial results, as long as we do not expect a significant reversal due to projected future hotel performance or cash flows in future periods.\nFranchise Fee and Royalty Fee Revenue: For our franchised properties, we have a performance obligation to provide franchisees and operators a license to our intellectual property for use of certain of our brand names. As compensation for such services, we are typically entitled to initial application fees and ongoing royalty fees. Our ongoing royalty fees represent variable consideration, as the transaction price is based on a percentage of certain revenues of the properties, as defined in each contract. We recognize royalty fees on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement as those amounts become payable. Initial application and relicensing fees are fixed consideration payable upon submission of a franchise application or renewal and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial or renewal term of the franchise agreements.\nOwned and Leased Hotel Revenue: At our owned and leased hotels, we have performance obligations to provide accommodations and other ancillary services to hotel guests. As compensation for such goods and services, we are typically entitled to a fixed nightly fee for an agreed upon period and additional fixed fees for any ancillary services purchased. These fees are generally payable at the time the hotel guest checks out of the hotel. We generally satisfy the performance obligations over time, and we recognize the revenue from room sales and from other ancillary guest services on a daily basis, as the rooms are occupied and we have rendered the services.\nCost Reimbursements: Under our management and franchise agreements, we are entitled to be reimbursed for certain costs we incur on behalf of the managed, franchised, and licensed properties, with no added mark-up. These costs primarily consist of payroll and related expenses at managed properties where we are the employer of the employees at the properties and include certain operational and administrative costs as provided for in our contracts with the owners. We are entitled to reimbursement in the period we incur the related reimbursable costs, which we recognize within the “Cost reimbursement revenue” caption of our Income Statements. Under our management and franchise agreements, hotel owners and franchisees participate in certain centralized programs and services, such as marketing, sales, reservations, and insurance programs. We operate these programs and services for the benefit of our hotel owners. We do not operate these programs and services to generate a profit over the long term, and accordingly, when we recover the costs that we incur for these programs and services from our hotel owners, we do not seek a mark-up. The amounts we charge for these programs and services are generally a combination of fixed fees and variable fees based on sales or other metrics and are payable on a monthly basis. We generally recognize revenue within the “Cost reimbursement revenue” caption of our Income Statements when the amounts may be billed to hotel owners, and we recognize expenses within the “Reimbursed expenses” caption as they are incurred. This pattern of recognition results in timing differences between the costs incurred for centralized programs and services and the related reimbursement from hotel owners in our operating and net income. Over the long term, these programs and services are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. In addition, we present in the “Reimbursed expenses” caption of our Income Statements spending funded by the proceeds ($664 million, $425 million after-tax) from the 2017 sale of our interest in Avendra LLC, which we committed would be used for the benefit of hotels in our system. Such spending totaled $161 million ($120 million after-tax) in 2023, $69 million ($52 million after-tax) in 2022, and $56 million ($42 million after-tax) in 2021.\nOther Revenue: Includes Global Design fees, which we describe below, termination fees, and other property and brand revenues. We generally recognize termination fees when collection is probable and other revenue as services are rendered. Amounts received in advance are deferred as liabilities.\nWe provide certain hotel design and construction review (“Global Design”) services to our managed and franchised hotel owners, generally during the period prior to a hotel’s opening or during the period a hotel is converting to a Marriott brand (the “pre-opening period”). As compensation for such services, we may be entitled to receive a fixed fee that is payable during the pre-opening period of the hotel. As these services are not a distinct performance obligation, we recognize the fees on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the management or franchise agreement within the “Owned, leased, and other revenue” caption of our Income Statements.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions: We do not disclose the amount of variable consideration that we expect to recognize in future periods in the following circumstances:\n(1) if we recognize the revenue based on the amount invoiced or services performed;\n(2) for sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property; or\n(3) if the consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation, and the terms of the consideration relate specifically to our efforts to transfer, or to a specific outcome from transferring the service.\nWe are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of governmental agencies and remit these to the applicable governmental agencies on a periodic basis. We do not include these taxes in determining the transaction price.\nLoyalty Program: Loyalty Program members earn points based on the money they spend at our properties; the exchange of timeshare ownership interests; purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products; and through participation in travel experiences and affiliated partners’ programs, such as those offered by credit card, car rental, airline, and other companies. Members can redeem points for stays at most of our properties, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, merchandise, and a variety of other awards.

The range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows:\nOn private equity, real estate, and certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds:\n \n \t•\t \t\n0.25% to 1.75% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period,\n \t•\t \t\n0.25% to 1.50% of invested capital, committed capital or investment fair value subsequent to the investment period for private equity and real estate funds, and\n \t•\t \t\n1.00% to 1.75% of invested capital or net asset value subsequent to the investment period for certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds.\nOn real estate and credit-focused funds structured like hedge funds:\n \n \t•\t \t\n0.50% to 1.00% of net asset value.\nOn credit separately managed accounts:\n \n \t•\t \t\n0.20% to 1.35% of net asset value or total assets.\nOn real estate separately managed accounts:\n \n \t•\t \t\n0.35% to 2.00% of invested capital, net operating income or net asset value.\nOn insurance separately managed accounts and investment vehicles:\n \n \t•\t \t\n0.25% to 1.00% of net asset value.\nOn funds of hedge funds, certain hedge funds and separately managed accounts invested in hedge funds:\n \n \t•\t \t\n0.20% to 1.50% of net asset value.\nOn CLO vehicles:\n \n \t•\t \t\n0.20% to 0.50% of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash.\nOn credit-focused registered and non-registered investment companies:\n \n \t•\t \t\n0.25% to 1.25% of total assets or net asset value.\nThe investment adviser of BXMT receives annual management fees based on 1.50% of BXMT’s net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated “distributable earnings” (which is generally equal to its GAAP net income excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments. The investment advisers of BREIT and BEPIF receive a management fee of 1.25% per annum of net asset value, payable monthly.\nManagement fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value, total assets, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. See “— Fair Value” below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments.\nInvestment Income (Loss) — Performance Allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. Blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle Blackstone to a Performance Allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the GAAP guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. Blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, Blackstone’s share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. Under the HLBV method, at the end of each reporting period Blackstone calculates the accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results.\nThe change in the fair value of the investments held by certain Blackstone Funds is a significant input into the accrued Performance Allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received Performance Allocations. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. See “— Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments.', 'The amount of revenue recognized as the Company satisfies performance obligations associated with contracts with customers is based upon the determination of transaction price. Transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled for performance under the terms and conditions of the relevant contract and may reflect fixed and variable components, including shareline incentive fees whereby the value of the contract is variable based upon the amount of costs incurred, as well as other incentive fees based upon achievement of contractual schedule commitments or other specified criteria in the contract. Shareline incentive fees are determined based upon the formula under the relevant contract using the Company’s estimated cost to complete for each period. The Company generally utilizes a most likely amount approach to estimate variable consideration. In all such instances, the estimated revenues represent those amounts for which the Company believes a significant reversal of revenue is not probable.', 'Incentive-based fees are recognized in income when the probability of significant reversal will not occur upon the resolution of the uncertainty, which is based on market performance.\n\nFees for managing customers’ mandatory retirement savings accounts in Latin America are collected with each monthly deposit made by our customers. If a customer stops contributing before retirement age, we collect no fees but services are still provided. We recognize revenue from these contracts as services are performed over the life of the contract and review annually.\nThe types of revenues from contracts with customers were as follows:\n\nFor the year ended December 31,\n\n \n\n\n    \n\n2023\n\n    \n\n2022\n\n    \n\n2021\n\n \n\n(in millions)\n\n \n\nPrincipal Global Investors:\n\nManagement fee revenue\n\n\n$\n\n1,372.0\n\n\n$\n\n1,434.6\n\n\n$\n\n  1,514.1 \n\n\nOther fee revenue\n\n\n \n\n182.1\n\n\n \n\n240.4\n\n\n \n\n  273.8 \n\n\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n\n1,554.1\n\n\n \n\n1,675.0\n\n\n \n\n  1,787.9 \n\n\nFees and other revenues not within the scope of revenue recognition guidance\n\n24.9\n\n\n \n\n27.4\n\n\n \n\n  36.2 \n\n\nTotal fees and other revenues\n\n1,579.0\n\n\n \n\n1,702.4\n\n\n \n\n  1,824.1 \n\n\nNet investment income\n\n32.2\n\n\n \n\n13.1\n\n\n \n\n  3.9 \n\n\nTotal operating revenues\n\n\n$\n\n1,611.2\n\n\n$\n\n1,715.5\n\n\n$\n\n  1,828.0 \n\n\nFor the year ended December 31,\n\n \n\n\n    \n\n2023\n\n    \n\n2022\n\n    \n\n2021\n\n \n\n\n \n\n(in millions)\n\n\nPrincipal International:\n\nManagement fee revenue\n\n\n$\n\n448.1\n\n\n$\n\n417.1\n\n\n$\n\n484.4\n\n\nOther fee revenue\n\n\n \n\n8.4\n\n\n \n\n9.2\n\n\n \n\n8.3', 'As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company executes trades between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller (“Open Trading”). Open Trading variable transaction fees, which represent commissions for matched principal trades, were $178.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Variable transaction fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type, size, yield, maturity of the bond traded, and individual client incentives. For Open Trading trades, the Company earns its commission through the difference in price between the two trades. As disclosed by management, commissions are determined based on the fee schedule associated with the instrument being traded.   \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for Open Trading commissions is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to this revenue type, which is calculated based on the instrument being traded, volume of the instrument being traded, and individual client incentives.', 'MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFiscal Years 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n \t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nREVENUES\t\t\t\t\t\nBase management fees\t$\t1,238 \t\t\t$\t1,044 \t\t\t$\t669 \t\nFranchise fees\t2,831 \t\t\t2,505 \t\t\t1,790 \t\nIncentive management fees\t755 \t\t\t529 \t\t\t235 \t\nGross fee revenues\t4,824 \t\t\t4,078 \t\t\t2,694 \t\nContract investment amortization\t(88)\t\t\t(89)\t\t\t(75)\t\nNet fee revenues\t4,736 \t\t\t3,989 \t\t\t2,619 \t\nOwned, leased, and other revenue\t1,564 \t\t\t1,367 \t\t\t796 \t\nCost reimbursement revenue (1)\n17,413 \t\t\t15,417 \t\t\t10,442 \t\n23,713 \t\t\t20,773 \t\t\t13,857 \t\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\t\t\t\t\t\nOwned, leased, and other - direct\n1,165 \t\t\t1,074 \t\t\t734 \t\nDepreciation, amortization, and other\t189 \t\t\t193 \t\t\t220 \t\nGeneral, administrative, and other\t1,011 \t\t\t891 \t\t\t823 \t\nMerger-related charges and other\n60 \t\t\t12 \t\t\t8 \t\nReimbursed expenses (1)\n17,424 \t\t\t15,141 \t\t\t10,322 \t\n19,849 \t\t\t17,311 \t\t\t12,107 \t\nOPERATING INCOME\t3,864 \t\t\t3,462 \t\t\t1,750 \t\nGains and other income, net\t40 \t\t\t11 \t\t\t10 \t\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t(164)\t\nInterest expense\t(565)\t\t\t(403)\t\t\t(420)\t\nInterest income\t30 \t\t\t26 \t\t\t28 \t\nEquity in earnings (losses) (1)\n9 \t\t\t18 \t\t\t(24)\t\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\t3,378 \t\t\t3,114 \t\t\t1,180 \t\nProvision for income taxes\n(295)\t\t\t(756)\t\t\t(81)\t\nNET INCOME\t$\t3,083 \t\t\t$\t2,358 \t\t\t$\t1,099 \t\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\t\t\t\t\t\nEarnings per share – basic\t$\t10.23 \t\t\t$\t7.27 \t\t\t$\t3.36 \t\nEarnings per share – diluted\t$\t10.18 \t\t\t$\t7.24 \t\t\t$\t3.34', 'For sales usage-based royalty products and services, we provide licenses conveying the right to continuous access to our intellectual property over the contract term, with revenue recognized when the extent of our license’s utilization can be quantified, or more specifically, when trading volumes are known and publicly available to us or when we are notified by our customers.

This ties those two performance-fee revenue lines directly to property operating results, making them rise or fall with hotel performance and introducing more short-term volatility, but preventing the early, potentially reversible, recognition of revenue."

57,57,23289cb7,CME Group's global F&O expansion leads to record contract vol. and has significant market growth implications.,"CME Group’s strategic focus on expanding its global futures and options offerings has directly contributed to its record average daily volume of 24.4 million contracts in 2023. By continuously enhancing its product suite—through the development and launch of a wide array of innovative products such as micro and specialty options on key benchmarks (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, and other asset classes), along with product extensions like enhanced SPAN margin tools—the company has attracted new customer segments and increased participation, especially from non-U.S. markets. This diversified product portfolio, combined with initiatives to deepen customer relationships, cross-sell offerings, and optimize global sales efforts, has driven record volumes not only in U.S. markets but also significant growth during European and Latin American trading hours (13% and 11% growth respectively). 

These record volumes indicate that CME Group is successfully tapping into global demand and positioning itself for sustained market growth. The ability to attract participation from various regions, coupled with strategic moves such as expanding cloud-based data distribution and enhancing liquidity analysis tools, suggests that the company is well-placed to further drive market penetration and capture additional growth momentum across futures and options trading globally.","[""The following is a description of our strategic initiatives:\nMaximize Futures and Options Growth Globally — We continue to focus on driving growth and new customer acquisition by expanding, innovating and scaling our core offerings, and increasing participation from non-U.S. customers. We do this by optimizing our global sales team, cross-selling certain products, expanding the strength of our existing benchmark products, launching new products and services, strengthening our existing product and service offerings, securing intellectual property rights to new products, enhancing our relationships and broadening our base of distribution partners, and deepening open interest in our core futures and options offerings. We have further focused on building upon cloud-based data distribution capabilities as a more flexible and potentially cost-effective means of providing data to our clients.\nIn 2023, CME Group futures and options had a record average daily volume of 24.4 million contracts, with a volume record in our interest rates asset class for the second consecutive year. It was also a year of volume records for multiple products, including Ultra 10 Year Treasury Note futures, SOFR futures, Bitcoin futures and a record number of contracts executed via Basis Trade at Index Close.\nWe continue to expand and deepen our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broad and diversified portfolio of benchmark products. Some of our products introduced over the past two years include:\n•CBL Core Global Emissions Offset (C-GEO) Futures (2022)\n•20-year U.S. Treasury Bond Futures (2022)\n•Micro Bitcoin and Ether Options (2022)\n•Aluminum Options (2022)\n•Micro WTI Options (2022)\n•Six new E-mini sector index Futures (2022)\n•Euro-denominated Bitcoin and Ether Futures (2022)\n•Ether Options (2022)\n•Ten event contracts linked to our global benchmarks (2022)\n•TBA futures for Mortgage-backed Securities (2022)\n•Euro Short-Term Rate (€STR) Futures (2022)\n•Additional Cryptocurrency Reference Rates and Real-Time Indices (2022 and 2023)\n•Event contracts on Bitcoin Futures (2023)\n•Micro E-mini S&P MidCap 400 and Micro E-mini S&P SmallCap 600 Futures (2023)\n•Offshore Renminbi Options (2023)\n•Lithium Carbonate Futures (2023)\n•Ether/Bitcoin Ratio Futures (2023)\n•T-Bill Futures (2023)\n•Options on Micro Gold Futures (2023)\n•Cobalt Hydroxide Futures (2023)\n•Micro Henry Hub Futures and Options (2023)\n•Additional short-term Options on U.S. Treasury Futures (2023)\nIn addition to the individual product launches noted above, we have completed many product extensions across our asset classes, including short-dated options products (Monday options on U.S. Treasury Futures, Monday and Wednesday options onWTI Crude Oil, Tuesday and Thursday options on E-mini Russell 2000, and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday options on Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500).\nWe continue to expand and deepen our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world with the most broad and diversified portfolio of benchmark products. We believe we have a significant opportunity to expand the participation of our non-U.S. customer base in our markets. Our penetration of these markets lags our development in the U.S., and we believe that there is room for significant growth and development of these financial markets. In 2023, approximately 30% of our electronic futures and options volume was from transactions reported as outside the U.S. and approximately 54% of our market data revenue was derived from outside the U.S. We also achieved 13% growth in trading volume during European trading hours and 11% growth during Latin America trading hours in 2023 compared to 2022.\nCME Group continues to introduce tools which assist our clients in managing their risks. The FX and Metals Market Profile Tools on Quant Analytics offer simple, but effective methods for clients to compare and contrast our leading FX and metals products and liquidity pools side-by-side, which in turn enables clients to analyze their opportunity to minimize costs and achieve best execution by accessing highly complementary liquidity pools across cash and futures markets. We expect to continue to expand this Quant Analytics suite in the future as well.\nOur CME Liquidity Tool enables market participants to analyze liquidity across CME Group products during U.S., London or Singapore trading hours and covers 37 products to meet customer demand for our growing product suite. CME Group Volatility Indexes (CVOL) comprises a total of 42 indexes, including 7 unique broad-based benchmarks such as the Treasury Volatility Index and Commodity Volatility Index. Our real-time streaming versions of the CVOL indexes provide a representative measure of the market expectation of 30-day forward risk, comprising both end of day and live streaming values. We have increased our customer base and continue to target cross-asset opportunities across client segments and across cash and futures platforms, driving global sales and generating new client participation across all regions. We have a long history of providing customer value and responsiveness and believe our products and services position us to help our customers adapt to and comply with new regulations, while enabling them to efficiently manage their risks. We have a broad distribution network comprised of a combination of internal and external channels and proprietary front-end capabilities.\nIn late 2023, we announced the launch of our new CME FX Spot+ as another tool for our customers to increase access, transparency and trading opportunities across spot FX and FX futures markets. CME FX Spot+ an all-to-all spot FX marketplace that will connect liquidity between two trading environments, whereby spot FX participants will have expanded access to CME FX futures liquidity in OTC spot terms within an open, transparent, central limit order book environment, while FX futures market users will see expanded access to OTC FX liquidity. We are expecting to start client testing in the second half of 2024.\nDiversify our Business and Revenue - Our acquisition of NEX strengthened our role in global financial markets infrastructure and information services, adding complementary cash and OTC businesses and scale to our listed interest rate and FX products, while broadening our global client base. We are positioned to take direct advantage of growth in treasury issuance, unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet, liquid treasury holdings and the trading of treasury instruments, as well as growing repo activity in the U.S. and Europe. The transaction expanded CME Group’s position in the large, highly competitive and highly fragmented global FX marketplace, offering both order book trading and relationship-based trading solutions for customers. The acquisition added strength in underlying customer marketplaces, especially around regional bank customers and other market participants outside of North America and expanded our market data solutions beyond futures and options into cash and OTC offerings.\nCME Group is well-positioned to capitalize on its ability to license CME Term SOFR, administered by our subsidiary, CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited. CME Term SOFR is the only SOFR rate endorsed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and the Federal Reserve Board has formally endorsed the forward-looking term rates based on SOFR. Through the end of 2023, we have licensed the CME Term SOFR benchmark to 2,975 firms and over 11,000 licensees in 100 countries.\nIn 2010, CME Group acquired a majority stake in Dow Jones Indexes, which was combined with S&P’s index business in 2012 to form S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, of which CME Group now has a 27% ownership stake. S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC combines the world class capabilities of the S&P and Dow Jones Indices, and is a significant player in passive investing, including the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry value chain. As part of the joint venture, we acquired a long-term, ownership-linked, exclusive license to list futures and options based on the S&P 500 Index and certain other S&P indices. We also act as the joint venture's licensing agent and distribution services provider. In 2022, we invested $410.0 million in this joint venture to fund our portion of the acquisition of the IHS Markit indices business, which includes leading fixed income and credit indices, such as iBoxx, iTraxx and CDX.\nIn 2021, CME Group and IHS Markit (later acquired by S&P Global) established a 50/50 joint venture, OSTTRA. We contributed to OSTTRA our trade processing/post-trade businesses (Traiana, TriOptima and Reset) and IHS Markit contributedits MarkitSERV business. OSTTRA serves as the leading optimization business and provider of progressive post-trade solutions for the global OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity and credit asset classes.\nDeliver Unparalleled Customer Efficiencies and Operational Excellence - With changing regulatory requirements for many of our customers, including additional margin requirements on uncleared trades, and the need for greater efficiencies, we have added tools to enable customers to manage clearing positions in our markets in an efficient manner. With the ongoing implementation of regulatory reform in the United States and in Europe, along with global implementation of Basel III capital requirements on financial institutions, we expect centralized clearing and capital efficiencies to continue to be important for our global client base.\nWe provide a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solution to market participants for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing house. Our clearing services offer the ability to optimize collateral and capital efficiencies across portfolios within the clearing house while meeting the heightened regulatory requirements on derivatives. The majority of our clearing volumes and activities are related to our listed futures and options, which represent the majority of our open interest and collateral held against these positions. We also offer clearing services for OTC interest rate swaps, FX forwards and commodity swaps.\nIn 2023, we launched CME SPAN 2 for certain futures and options on energy products, an enhancement of our Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) margin framework, which provides enhanced risk management capabilities in a single, unified interface across futures and options, cleared OTC products and portfolio margining programs. In 2024, we are expecting to expand SPAN 2 to other asset classes. As CME SPAN 2 is implemented, margins for diversified portfolios will consist of products using the enhanced CME SPAN 2 framework, in addition to the existing SPAN framework, ensuring appropriate levels of offsets will continue to be provided across products subject to the SPAN and SPAN 2 frameworks.\nCME Group provides various tools and services to assist customers with capital and operational efficiencies, including:\n•CME Clearing provides compression via coupon blending as well as CME CORE, an interactive margin calculator that enables clients to optimize their capital by providing insights on margin requirements prior to trading.\n•Portfolio margining allows firms to capitalize on margin offsets between futures, options and cleared OTC instruments with common risk factors.\nCross-margining allows firms to achieve portfolio margin efficiencies for offsetting positions between two clearing houses, including CME and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) or CME and Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), through reduced performance bond requirements. Through an enhancement to our arrangement with FICC, in January 2024, we began offering enhanced capital efficiencies to our eligible clearing members when trading U.S. Treasury securities and CME interest rate futures.\nPartnership with Google Cloud - In November 2021, we announced a 10-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to accelerate CME Group’s move to the cloud, which we expect will transform derivatives markets by expanding access and creating efficiencies for market participants. The partnership will focus on expanding access to CME Group’s infrastructure, advancing real-time data and analytics capabilities, co-innovating new products and services, increasing efficiencies and driving resiliency in the financial markets’ ecosystem. In 2022, we built our cloud instance on the Google Cloud platform. In 2023, we have been executing against the plans to move our non-latency sensitive applications, including clearing and data, to the Cloud. The migration of these applications will enable us to commercialize and launch new clearing and data products.""]",,,FinDER,Non-numerical,"[""The following is a description of our strategic initiatives:\nMaximize Futures and Options Growth Globally — We continue to focus on driving growth and new customer acquisition by expanding, innovating and scaling our core offerings, and increasing participation from non-U.S. customers.

The FX and Metals Market Profile Tools on Quant Analytics offer simple, but effective methods for clients to compare and contrast our leading FX and metals products and liquidity pools side-by-side, which in turn enables clients to analyze their opportunity to minimize costs and achieve best execution by accessing highly complementary liquidity pools across cash and futures markets. We expect to continue to expand this Quant Analytics suite in the future as well.\nOur CME Liquidity Tool enables market participants to analyze liquidity across CME Group products during U.S., London or Singapore trading hours and covers 37 products to meet customer demand for our growing product suite. CME Group Volatility Indexes (CVOL) comprises a total of 42 indexes, including 7 unique broad-based benchmarks such as the Treasury Volatility Index and Commodity Volatility Index. Our real-time streaming versions of the CVOL indexes provide a representative measure of the market expectation of 30-day forward risk, comprising both end of day and live streaming values. We have increased our customer base and continue to target cross-asset opportunities across client segments and across cash and futures platforms, driving global sales and generating new client participation across all regions. We have a long history of providing customer value and responsiveness and believe our products and services position us to help our customers adapt to and comply with new regulations, while enabling them to efficiently manage their risks. We have a broad distribution network comprised of a combination of internal and external channels and proprietary front-end capabilities.\nIn late 2023, we announced the launch of our new CME FX Spot+ as another tool for our customers to increase access, transparency and trading opportunities across spot FX and FX futures markets. CME FX Spot+ an all-to-all spot FX marketplace that will connect liquidity between two trading environments, whereby spot FX participants will have expanded access to CME FX futures liquidity in OTC spot terms within an open, transparent, central limit order book environment, while FX futures market users will see expanded access to OTC FX liquidity. We are expecting to start client testing in the second half of 2024.\nDiversify our Business and Revenue - Our acquisition of NEX strengthened our role in global financial markets infrastructure and information services, adding complementary cash and OTC businesses and scale to our listed interest rate and FX products, while broadening our global client base. We are positioned to take direct advantage of growth in treasury issuance, unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet, liquid treasury holdings and the trading of treasury instruments, as well as growing repo activity in the U.S. and Europe. The transaction expanded CME Group’s position in the large, highly competitive and highly fragmented global FX marketplace, offering both order book trading and relationship-based trading solutions for customers. The acquisition added strength in underlying customer marketplaces, especially around regional bank customers and other market participants outside of North America and expanded our market data solutions beyond futures and options into cash and OTC offerings.\nCME Group is well-positioned to capitalize on its ability to license CME Term SOFR, administered by our subsidiary, CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited. CME Term SOFR is the only SOFR rate endorsed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and the Federal Reserve Board has formally endorsed the forward-looking term rates based on SOFR. Through the end of 2023, we have licensed the CME Term SOFR benchmark to 2,975 firms and over 11,000 licensees in 100 countries.\nIn 2010, CME Group acquired a majority stake in Dow Jones Indexes, which was combined with S&P’s index business in 2012 to form S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, of which CME Group now has a 27% ownership stake. S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC combines the world class capabilities of the S&P and Dow Jones Indices, and is a significant player in passive investing, including the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry value chain. As part of the joint venture, we acquired a long-term, ownership-linked, exclusive license to list futures and options based on the S&P 500 Index and certain other S&P indices. We also act as the joint venture's licensing agent and distribution services provider. In 2022, we invested $410.0 million in this joint venture to fund our portion of the acquisition of the IHS Markit indices business, which includes leading fixed income and credit indices, such as iBoxx, iTraxx and CDX.\nIn 2021, CME Group and IHS Markit (later acquired by S&P Global) established a 50/50 joint venture, OSTTRA. We contributed to OSTTRA our trade processing/post-trade businesses (Traiana, TriOptima and Reset) and IHS Markit contributedits MarkitSERV business. OSTTRA serves as the leading optimization business and provider of progressive post-trade solutions for the global OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity and credit asset classes.\nDeliver Unparalleled Customer Efficiencies and Operational Excellence - With changing regulatory requirements for many of our customers, including additional margin requirements on uncleared trades, and the need for greater efficiencies, we have added tools to enable customers to manage clearing positions in our markets in an efficient manner. With the ongoing implementation of regulatory reform in the United States and in Europe, along with global implementation of Basel III capital requirements on financial institutions, we expect centralized clearing and capital efficiencies to continue to be important for our global client base.\nWe provide a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solution to market participants for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing house. Our clearing services offer the ability to optimize collateral and capital efficiencies across portfolios within the clearing house while meeting the heightened regulatory requirements on derivatives. The majority of our clearing volumes and activities are related to our listed futures and options, which represent the majority of our open interest and collateral held against these positions. We also offer clearing services for OTC interest rate swaps, FX forwards and commodity swaps.\nIn 2023, we launched CME SPAN 2 for certain futures and options on energy products, an enhancement of our Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) margin framework, which provides enhanced risk management capabilities in a single, unified interface across futures and options, cleared OTC products and portfolio margining programs. In 2024, we are expecting to expand SPAN 2 to other asset classes. As CME SPAN 2 is implemented, margins for diversified portfolios will consist of products using the enhanced CME SPAN 2 framework, in addition to the existing SPAN framework, ensuring appropriate levels of offsets will continue to be provided across products subject to the SPAN and SPAN 2 frameworks.\nCME Group provides various tools and services to assist customers with capital and operational efficiencies, including:\n•CME Clearing provides compression via coupon blending as well as CME CORE, an interactive margin calculator that enables clients to optimize their capital by providing insights on margin requirements prior to trading.\n•Portfolio margining allows firms to capitalize on margin offsets between futures, options and cleared OTC instruments with common risk factors.\nCross-margining allows firms to achieve portfolio margin efficiencies for offsetting positions between two clearing houses, including CME and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) or CME and Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), through reduced performance bond requirements. Through an enhancement to our arrangement with FICC, in January 2024, we began offering enhanced capital efficiencies to our eligible clearing members when trading U.S. Treasury securities and CME interest rate futures.\nPartnership with Google Cloud - In November 2021, we announced a 10-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to accelerate CME Group’s move to the cloud, which we expect will transform derivatives markets by expanding access and creating efficiencies for market participants. The partnership will focus on expanding access to CME Group’s infrastructure, advancing real-time data and analytics capabilities, co-innovating new products and services, increasing efficiencies and driving resiliency in the financial markets’ ecosystem. In 2022, we built our cloud instance on the Google Cloud platform. In 2023, we have been executing against the plans to move our non-latency sensitive applications, including clearing and data, to the Cloud.

We do this by optimizing our global sales team, cross-selling certain products, expanding the strength of our existing benchmark products, launching new products and services, strengthening our existing product and service offerings, securing intellectual property rights to new products, enhancing our relationships and broadening our base of distribution partners, and deepening open interest in our core futures and options offerings.

In the normal course of business, the company discusses matters with its regulators raised during regulatory examinations or otherwise subject to their inquiry and oversight. These matters could result in censures, fines, penalties or other sanctions. Management believes the outcome of any resulting actions will not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, the company is unable to predict the outcome or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or the potential fines, penalties or injunctive or other equitable relief, if any, that may result from these matters.\nA putative class action complaint was filed January 15, 2014 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery Division, against CME Group Inc. and the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. The plaintiffs, certain Class B shareholders of CME Group and Class B members of CBOT, allege breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing for violations of their core rights granted in the defendants’ respective Certificates of Incorporation. On December 2, 2021, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for certification of a damages-only class. No trial date has been set. Given the uncertainty of factors that may potentially affect the resolution of the matter, at this time the company is unable to estimate the\nreasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible losses in the unlikely event it were found to be liable at trial. Based on its investigation to date, the company believes that it has strong factual and legal defenses to the claims.\nIn addition, the company is a defendant in, and has potential for, various other legal proceedings arising from its regular business activities. While the ultimate results of such proceedings against the company cannot be predicted with certainty, the company believes that the resolution of any of these matters on an individual or aggregate basis will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nNo accrual was required for contingent legal and regulatory matters as none were probable and estimable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIntellectual Property Indemnifications. Certain agreements with customers and other third parties related to accessing the CME Group platforms, utilizing market data services and licensing CME SPAN software may contain indemnifications from intellectual property claims that may be made against them as a result of their use of the applicable products and/or services. The potential future claims relating to these indemnifications cannot be estimated and therefore no liability has been recorded."", 'Continue Expansion into New Product Areas  \n\nBy leveraging our Open Trading functionality and capitalizing on our experience of building market share in markets like U.S high-grade and U.S. high-yield bonds, we plan to increase our product footprint in newer product areas, including emerging market local currency bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds and European government bonds. Each of these markets has unique trading protocols, market structures and settlement solutions that require a lengthy ramp-up period, but which will provide diverse revenue sources if we can obtain significant market share. For example, in 2021, we acquired MuniBrokers LLC (“MuniBrokers”), a central electronic trading venue serving municipal bond inter-dealer brokers and dealers, in order to expand our existing municipal bond trading solution. The acquisition connects our leading trading technology with the liquidity of one of the industry’s largest electronic inter-dealer marketplaces, creating a compelling and diverse liquidity solution that we believe will ultimately deliver an improved execution experience. In addition, with the acquisition of Pragma in 2023, we have expanded our automated and algorithmic trading solutions to new asset classes, including equities and foreign exchange. \n\nExpand Trading Protocols and Leverage the Open Trading Network', 'We believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths, including: \n\nExpansive Liquidity Pool Comprised of Leading Broker-Dealers and Institutional Investors \n\nOur electronic trading platforms provide access to the liquidity generated by the participation of our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, including substantially all of the leading broker-dealers in global fixed-income trading. We believe these broker-dealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for credit and rates products. We believe that our broker-dealer clients are incentivized to use our platforms due to the ability to efficiently transact with valuable client order flow and the ability to use our Open Trading protocols to help manage their risk, source liquidity and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients. \n\nOur total credit trading volume has increased from approximately $2.0 trillion in 2019 to $3.1 trillion in 2023 and our estimated market share of U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate bond volumes in 2023 was 20.4% and 17.1%, respectively. Approximately 90.9% of credit volume on our platforms during 2023 was executed by institutional clients with the remaining 9.1% of credit volume conducted between dealers.', 'Continue to Invest in and Grow our Business through Geographic Diversification\n\nWe are continuing to expand and diversify our business internationally.

As of December 31, 2023, our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients are based in over 90 countries with over 1,000 total active international client firms and approximately 5,800 total active international traders. We offer cross-regional electronic trading services in U.S fixed-income markets for international clients, as well as in Eurobonds and emerging market debt. By offering liquidity in both hard-currency and local currency emerging market debt, we have created an efficient emerging market trading ecosystem for our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. In the last five years, we have seen significant growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Latin America and APAC regions. The ADV in the EMEA, Latin America and APAC regions on the MarketAxess platforms has grown from $2.5 billion in 2019 to $4.2 billion in 2023. We believe we can increase our penetration and revenue opportunities in international markets by continuing to invest in creating client relationships abroad.\nPursue Select Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances', 'Increase Penetration in Credit Markets\n\nWe believe that we have a large opportunity remaining to capture additional market share in the credit product markets in which we have already established a leadership position. For example, the estimated Composite Corporate Bond average daily volume (“ADV”) on our platforms for the year ended December 31, 2023 for our combined U.S. high-grade, U.S. high-yield, emerging markets and Eurobonds product areas (collectively, “Composite Corporate Bond”) was approximately $9.8 billion, representing just 19.3% of the estimated addressable market of approximately $51.1 billion. The traditional methods of bilateral trading, including the telephone or electronic messaging, continue to be one of our principal competitors in the credit markets in which we have established a leadership position. We continue to focus on capturing additional market share across our core credit markets. In 2023, we introduced X-Pro, our new trading platform, to clients in the United States. We believe that the modernized design of X-Pro will help increase our market share in our core markets. X-Pro also includes enhanced functionality for portfolio trading, which has represented a larger proportion of trading volumes in recent periods.\n\nContinue Expansion into New Product Areas', 'Expand Trading Protocols and Leverage the Open Trading Network \n\nWe believe that we are the only fixed-income electronic trading platform that embraces all-to-all trading in each of our product areas. Open Trading exponentially increases the number of potential trading counterparties by allowing both our broker-dealer clients and institutional investor clients to interact in an all-to-all trading environment of over 1,700 firms. Our clients executed approximately $955.6 billion in credit trading volume using Open Trading during 2023, representing 35.2% of total eligible credit trading volume on our platforms, and realized approximately $701.9 million in estimated price improvement through this unique liquidity solution in 2023. We believe that the combination of Open Trading and our vast client network provides the basis for MarketAxess to enhance liquidity and improve market resiliency in global fixed-income markets. In 2023, we introduced Open Trading for emerging market local currency bonds, including for the local currency markets of Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and South Africa.\n\nContinue to Invest in and Grow our Business through Geographic Diversification', ""Cboe Global Markets, Inc., the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions to people around the world.

58,58,f20b0c16,"Profitability ratios, pricing, cost control trends, and future outlook for Hershey, HSY.","The income statement data allows us to derive and analyze key profitability ratios—such as the gross margin and operating margin—to infer insights about Hershey’s pricing power and cost control over the past three years. A closer look reveals the following:

1. Gross Profit Margins: 
   • 2021: Gross margin was approximately 45.2% (4,048,598 / 8,971,337),
   • 2022: Dropped to around 43.2% (4,498,785 / 10,419,294),
   • 2023: Recovered to about 44.8% (4,997,816 / 11,164,992).
   The slight dip in 2022 followed by a recovery in 2023 suggests that while Hershey may have faced pricing or input cost challenges in 2022, the rebound indicates an effective response perhaps through improved pricing strategies or a better mix of products.

2. Operating Margins:
   • 2021: Operating margin was about 22.8% (2,043,722 / 8,971,337),
   • 2022: Fell slightly to about 21.7% (2,260,787 / 10,419,294),
   • 2023: Increased to around 22.9% (2,560,867 / 11,164,992).
   This improvement in 2023 relative to 2022 suggests that the company was able to better control its selling, marketing, and administrative expenses despite increasing net sales. Maintaining these expense ratios while growing sales is indicative of effective cost management.

3. Pricing and Cost Control Strategies:
   • The recovery in gross margin in 2023 combined with the improvement in operating margin suggests that Hershey has been successful in adjusting its pricing to better cover cost pressures or perhaps shifting its sales mix toward higher-margin products.
   • The relatively consistent expense ratios (as evidenced by the S&M expense as a percentage of net sales—roughly stable over the three years) point to disciplined cost management, even as the company grows its scale.

4. Implications for Future Profitability and Competitive Positioning:
   • If Hershey continues to leverage effective pricing strategies while keeping costs under control, it is well positioned to maintain or even improve its profitability. A resilient margin profile reflects both competitive product pricing and operational efficiency.
   • Furthermore, strong cost control combined with adaptive pricing can enhance competitive positioning in the market. It means Hershey is potentially better equipped to absorb input cost volatility and competitive pressures, thereby supporting sustainable growth in future quarters.

In summary, the trends over the three years indicate that Hershey has navigated cost pressures by fine-tuning its pricing and maintaining tight cost control. These strategies have helped preserve healthy margins and should continue to support both robust profitability and a strong competitive position in the market.","['THE HERSHEY COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED

customer orders for the purchase of our products, including chocolate, sweets, mints and other grocery and snack offerings. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for these contracts based on our selling list price which is then reduced by estimated costs for trade promotional programs, consumer incentives, and allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsaleable products. We recognize revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product(s) is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon delivery to the customer or other customer-designated delivery point. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis.\nOur trade promotional programs and consumer incentives are used to promote our products and include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, and volume-based incentives. The estimated costs\n associated with these programs and incentives are based upon our analysis of the programs offered, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, historical sales and payment trends, and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3%. The Company’s unsettled portion remaining in accrued liabilities at year-end for these activities was $194,032 and $215,688 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe also recognize a minor amount of royalty income (less than 1% of our consolidated net sales) from sales-based licensing arrangements, pursuant to which revenue is recognized as the third-party licensee sales occur. Shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver product to the customer are recorded within cost of sales. Sales, value add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue.\nThe majority of our products are confectionery or confectionery-based and, therefore, exhibit similar economic characteristics, as they are based on similar ingredients and are marketed and sold through the same channels to the same customers. In connection with our recent acquisitions, we have expanded our portfolio of salty snacking products, which also exhibit similar economic characteristics to our confectionery products and are sold through the same channels to the same customers.

In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. As a result of the February 2023 Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Milton Hershey School Trust (the “School Trust”), the July 2018 share repurchase authorization was completed and as of December 31, 2023, approximately $370 million remained available for repurchases of our Common Stock under our May 2021 share repurchase authorization. In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. This program is to commence after the existing 2021 authorization is completed and is to be utilized at management’s discretion. The May 2021 and December 2023 share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date.\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock from the School Trust at a price equal to $239.91 per share, for a total purchase price of $239.9 million.\nIn February 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock from the School Trust at a price equal to $203.35 per share, for a total purchase price of $203.4 million.', 'Our businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages, including the breadth and depth of our product offerings and our strong relationships with customers, including hospitals and clinics, GPOs, IDNs, physicians and patients, many of whom self-administer home-based therapies that we supply. We also benefit from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of our products.\nAlthough no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in each of our segments from international and domestic healthcare, medical products and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. In addition, global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels. We believe customer purchasing decisions are primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance and technological innovation. There has been consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors, which continues to result in pricing and market pressures.\nGlobal efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies (lists of recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In the United States, the federal government and many states have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that we and other providers are required to pay to the state. In addition to government regulation, managed care organizations in the United States, which include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations, hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers, continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products. Managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures, and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients. We face similar issues outside of the United States. In Europe and Latin America, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, China has been implementing volume-based procurement policies and a series of centralized reforms on both a national and regional basis which have resulted in significant price cuts for pharmaceuticals and medical consumables.

Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.', 'We measure our progress toward achieving our strategic goals based on our performance with respect to the following key priorities: free cash flow, profitable growth, enhanced margins, and talent development.

Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. Overall, volume/mix was favorable driven by improved product mix. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate, gum and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery and candy. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies across the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone, Ukrainian hryvnya and Swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Polish zloty, British pound sterling and Swiss franc.

• Operating margin: 22.9 % | 21.7 % | 22.8 %  
• Net margin: 16.7 % | 15.8 % | 16.5 %

Pricing & revenue growth  
• Net sales rose 7.2 % in 2023 (11.2 B vs 10.4 B) after a 16.1 % jump in 2022, largely driven by list-price increases and disciplined trade-promotion spending (actual promo costs have stayed within ±3 % of estimates).  
• Hershey’s concentration at convenience & mass-merchandise channels (e.g., McLane/Walmart ≈28 % of sales) gives it scale to pass through price hikes.

Cost-control trends  
• Cost of sales grew only 4.2 % in 2023, slower than revenue, trimming the cost-of-goods ratio to 55.2 % from 56.8 %.  
• SG&A held near 22 % of sales despite inflation and brand investment (2.44 B, +9 % YoY).  
• Operating profit therefore advanced 13.3 % to 2.56 B, with margins back above pre-2022 levels.  
• Ongoing share-buybacks (≈370 M left on 2021 plan plus new 500 M authorization) support EPS growth and return on equity.

Future outlook  
Hershey enters 2024 with strengthened margins, proven pricing power, and room to offset inflation through additional productivity programs and portfolio mix (salty snacks, premium chocolate). Key watch-points are cocoa/sugar cost spikes and consumer elasticity, but management’s stated priorities—profitable growth, margin enhancement, and robust free cash flow—suggest continued high-teens net margins and steady EPS accretion barring a severe commodity shock."

60,60,28401679,Risk profile of long-term liabilities for Bio-Rad includes cash outflows. BIO.,"The data provided allow us to assess the implications of Bio-Rad’s long-term liabilities—for example, post-employment benefits and deferred revenue obligations—on the company’s risk profile and future cash outflow expectations. Here are the key insights:

1. Timing and Magnitude of Cash Outflows: The long-term liabilities total $121.7 million, but only a small portion ($4.3 million) is due within one year. A significant amount ($70.4 million) is scheduled for payments beyond five years, with the remainder spread over the 1–3 and 3–5 year periods. This staggered maturity reduces near-term liquidity pressure, yet it commits the company to future cash outflows that must be managed over the long term.

2. Impact on Liquidity and Financial Flexibility: While the immediate liquidity risk is low due to the small near-term amount, the existence of long-term obligations (which include post-employment benefits and deferred revenue) means that Bio-Rad will need to ensure it generates sufficient cash flows or has access to financing in the future. This can somewhat constrain the company’s operational and investment flexibility if future cash flows are not robust or if unexpected economic conditions arise.

3. Risk Profile Considerations:
   - Post-Employment Benefits: These obligations, which are part of the long-term liabilities, are sensitive to factors such as demographic shifts, changes in benefit structures, and actuarial assumptions. If underestimated, they could become a larger cash burden in the future. 
   - Deferred Revenue: Although deferred revenue represents payments received for services or products not yet delivered, it creates an obligation to eventually fulfill these services. Any delays or issues in delivering these services could impact customer satisfaction and revenue realization.

4. Overall Impact: While the deferred timing of most cash outflows mitigates immediate liquidity issues, the long-term nature of these obligations adds to the company’s risk profile by creating future fixed cash commitments. Investors and management must monitor these obligations closely, ensuring that the firm’s long-term cash flow generation and financing strategies are robust enough to meet these future demands.

In summary, the long-term liabilities add a layer of risk by committing Bio-Rad to substantial future cash outflows that, if not managed properly or if cash flow deteriorates, could impact the company’s financial flexibility and overall risk profile.","['The following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods (in millions):\nPayments Due by Period\nLess\nThan\t\t1-3\t\t3-5\t\tMore\nthan\nContractual Obligations\t\tTotal\t\tOne Year\t\tYears\t\tYears\t\t5 Years\nLong-term debt, including current portion (1)\n$\t1,210.1 \t\t\t$\t0.5 \t\t\t$\t1.0 \t\t\t$\t401.0 \t\t\t$\t807.6 \t\nInterest payments (1)\n$\t301.7 \t\t\t$\t44.0 \t\t\t$\t87.9 \t\t\t$\t64.1 \t\t\t$\t105.7 \t\nOperating lease obligations (2)\n$\t236.3 \t\t\t$\t46.6 \t\t\t$\t78.4 \t\t\t$\t45.8 \t\t\t$\t65.5 \t\nPurchase obligations (3)\n$\t122.6 \t\t\t$\t96.4 \t\t\t$\t26.1 \t\t\t$\t0.1 \t\t\t$\t— \t\nLong-term liabilities (4)\n$\t121.7 \t\t\t$\t4.3 \t\t\t$\t36.5 \t\t\t$\t10.5 \t\t\t$\t70.4 \t\n(1) These amounts represent expected cash payments, primarily from Senior Notes, which are included in our December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet.

At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we held cash and short-term investments of $3.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. Our short-term investments are generally readily marketable and can be converted to cash. In addition to these cash and short-term investments, at December 31, 2023, we had $1.3 billion of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $6.9 billion maturing within one to five years and $7.9 billion maturing after five years. We believe that these fixed maturity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses and LAE in the near future. We do not anticipate selling a significant amount of securities. Sales of securities might result in realized gains or losses. At December 31, 2023 we had $780 million of net pre-tax unrealized depreciation related to fixed maturity - available for sale securities, comprised of $1.1 billion of pre-tax unrealized depreciation and $358 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation.\nManagement generally expects annual positive cash flow from operations, which reflects the strength of overall pricing as well as the growth in business written. However, given catastrophic events observed in recent periods, cash flow from operations may decline and could become negative in the near term as significant claim payments are made related to the catastrophes. However, as indicated above, the Company has ample liquidity to settle its catastrophe claims and/or any payments due for its catastrophe bond program.\nIn addition to our cash flows from operations and liquid investments, we also have multiple active credit facilities that provide commitments of up to $1.7 billion of collateralized standby letters of credit to support business written by our Bermuda operating subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has the ability to request access to an additional $240 million of uncommitted credit facilities, which would require approval from the applicable lender.

For example, we have experienced a decline in customer demand for our COVID-19 vaccine, reflecting the market's ongoing transition to a seasonal model in an endemic market in 2023. We foresee that our commitment to investing in our business for future product launches may lead to continued negative cash flows from operations in upcoming periods. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors.

The sum of the estimated cash flows of $310.4 billion ($22.3 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amounts of $219.7 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, most significantly mortality, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nThe estimated cash flows reflect future estimated cash payments and (i) are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns; and (ii) consider future premium receipts on current policies in-force. Estimated cash payments are undiscounted as to interest, net of estimated future premiums on in-force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Payment of amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity.\nActual cash payments may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented on the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments.\nFor the majority of our insurance operations, estimated contractual obligations for FPBs and PABs are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes.

Rollover risk is the risk that we will not be able to refinance or payoff borrowings as they mature. We manage rollover risk on borrowings, taking into account expected principal paydowns on our investment and loan portfolios along with expected deposit flows.']",995.5713340314104,"Bio-Rad’s recognized long-term liabilities total 121.7 million, with only 4.3 million (≈3 %) due in the next year, 36.5 million (≈30 %) in years 1–3, 10.5 million (≈9 %) in years 3–5, and the bulk—70.4 million (≈58 %)—payable after five years, giving the company a back-loaded cash-outflow profile and limited short-term liquidity risk."

62,62,f934797b,FRT board structure; exec vs non-exec (signature page),"The signature page clearly identifies the leadership roles on the board. There are a total of eight board members. Two of these are executive officers: Donald C. Wood, who serves as the Chief Executive Officer (and is noted as the Principal Executive Officer), and Daniel Guglielmone, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (also serving as the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer). The remaining six board members are non‐executive trustees. This group includes David W. Faeder, who is designated as the Non‐Executive Chairman, along with trustees Elizabeth I. Holland, Nicole Y. Lamb-Hale, Thomas A. McEachin, Anthony P. Nader, III, and Gail P. Steinel. Thus, the board is structured with two executives overseeing day-to-day management and six non-executive trustees providing independent oversight.","['Signature\t  \tTitle\t \tDate\n/S/ DONALD C.

63,63,19da35fd,CNP net premiums as % of rev in 2023 vs. historical trends for Chubb.,"For 2023, net premiums earned were $45,712 million, while total revenues were $49,735 million. The percentage can be calculated as (45,712 / 49,735) × 100 ≈ 91.9%. In comparison, in 2022, net premiums earned were $40,360 million out of total revenues of $43,097 million, which is about (40,360 / 43,097) × 100 ≈ 93.7%, and in 2021, net premiums earned were $36,292 million out of $40,869 million in total revenues, approximately (36,292 / 40,869) × 100 ≈ 88.9%. Thus, while net premiums earned constitute a major component of total revenues each year, the proportion was highest in 2022, slightly lower in 2023, and the lowest in 2021.","['CONSOLIDATED

revenues increased $1,437 million (12.6%), due to higher net pricing (13.8 pp), favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp) and the impact from short-term distributor agreements (0.2 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (1.9 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp). Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. Overall, volume/mix was favorable driven by improved product mix. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate, gum and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery and candy. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies across the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone, Ukrainian hryvnya and Swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Polish zloty, British pound sterling and Swiss franc.

Working capital increased primarily from cash generated from operations and timing of cash receipts and payments, partially offset by capital expenditures and certain income tax benefits related to stock option exercises and timing of cash payments. Cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits, certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury Bills, and funds invested in money market accounts, which bear interest at variable rates.', 'Working capital at October 31, 2024, and October 31, 2023, was $928.7 million and $735.9 million, respectively.

The table below presents the cash conversion cycle: \nAs of October 31\n2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\nDays of sales outstanding in accounts receivable (“DSO”)\t33 \t\t\t28 \t\t\t28 \t\nDays of supply in inventory (“DOS”)\t63 \t\t\t57 \t\t\t57 \t\nDays of purchases outstanding in accounts payable (“DPO”)\t(138)\t\t\t(117)\t\t\t(114)\t\nCash conversion cycle\t(42)\t\t\t(32)\t\t\t(29)\t\n \nOctober 31, 2024 as compared to October 31, 2023\nThe cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from historical trends include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms, timing and extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.\nDSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, by a 90-day average of net revenue. The increase in DSO was primarily due to unfavorable revenue linearity.\nDOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. The increase in DOS is primarily due to strategic buys in Personal Systems and higher in-transit shipments.\nDPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. The increase in DPO as compared to prior-year period, was primarily due to higher manufacturing volumes in Personal Systems as well as favorable changes in payment terms.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $0.1 billion for fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to payments made in connection with acquisitions.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $0.2 billion in fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher share repurchases of $2.0 billion, partially offset by lower net debt repayment of $1.6 billion and collateral returned for derivative instruments of $0.2 billion in the prior-year period.', 'The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.\n\nCash Flow\n\nNet cash provided by operations increased to $3,745 in 2023 as compared to $2,556 in 2022, primarily due to changes in working capital and higher net income. The Company’s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (1.4)% in 2023 and 1.0% in 2022. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to higher accounts payable and accruals, and lower inventory. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). \n\nInvesting activities used $742 of cash in 2023 compared to $1,601 during 2022.

Restricted cash was $2 million at each of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nIn 2023, we repatriated $435 million in cash to the U.S. from international jurisdictions. We routinely repatriate a portion of non-U.S. earnings each year. We have recorded income tax expense for foreign withholding tax and distribution taxes on such earnings and, under current U.S. tax laws, do not expect to incur material incremental U.S. tax on repatriation.\nWhere appropriate, we may also pursue capital reduction activities; however, such activities can be involved and lengthy. While we regularly repatriate funds, and a portion of offshore funds can be repatriated with minimal adverse financial impact, repatriation of some of these funds may be subject to delay due to local country approvals.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in operating cash flows from 2022 to 2023 was driven by:\n•higher earnings, net of non-cash charges; and\n•improved working capital; partially offset by\n•$280 million of higher income tax payments, including a one-time $70 million cash tax payment made in 2023 related to an intra-group transfer of certain IP rights that was completed in 2022 (see ""Note 7: Income Taxes"" to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information).\nThe decrease in operating cash flows from 2021 to 2022 was driven by:\n•an increase in working capital, inclusive of higher inventory;\n•higher employee incentive costs; and\n•$50 million of higher income tax payments; partially offset by\n•higher earnings.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease in net cash used for investing activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to:\n•$997 million decrease in acquisitions and investments, driven by acquisitions and investments of $180 million in 2023 compared to $1.2 billion in 2022; and\n•$3 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2023 compared to 2022; partially offset by\n•$27 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments in 2023 compared to 2022.\nThe increase in net cash used for investing activities from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to:\n•$656 million increase in acquisitions and investments, driven by acquisitions of $1.2 billion in 2022 compared to $521 million in 2021;\n•$30 million increase in proceeds from the sale of investments in 2022 compared to 2021; and\n•$13 million increase in capital expenditures in 2022 compared to 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase in cash used for financing activities in 2023 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2022 was driven by (also see further discussion in ""Debt,"" ""Credit Facilities,"" ""Share Repurchase Program"" and ""Dividends"" in this section below):\n•$589 million cash used for the payment of dividends in 2023 compared to $530 million in 2022; and\n•$104 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans in 2023 compared to $156 million in 2022; partially offset by\n•$595 million in net proceeds in 2022 from the issuance of $600 million of 5.6% senior notes due 2032, of which a portion was subsequently used to repurchase $275 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes due 2024 for a purchase price of $279 million, excluding $3 million of accrued interest; and\n•$804 million used for purchases under our share repurchase program in 2023 compared to $836 million in 2022.\nThe increase in cash used for financing activities in 2022 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2021 was driven by:\n•$836 million used for purchases under our share repurchase program in 2022 compared to $528 million in 2021; and\n•$530 million cash used for the payment of dividends in 2022 compared to $482 million in 2021; partially offset by\n•$595 million net proceeds in 2022 from the issuance of $600 million of 5.6% senior notes due 2032, of which a portion was subsequently used to repurchase $275 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes due 2024 for a purchase price of $279 million, excluding $3 million of accrued interest.', 'At September 30, 2024, operating working capital as a percent of sales was 8.0 percent compared with 8.5 percent in 2023 and 7.2 percent in 2022. Total operating working capital increased in 2024 due to the NI acquisition, but improved as a percent of sales compared to 2023 due improvements in inventory levels. Operating working capital was elevated in 2023 due to higher inventory levels to support sales growth and higher receivables.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing operations (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was $2,898 in 2024, up 23 percent, reflecting the increase in operating cash flow. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $2,347 in 2023, compared with $1,749 in 2022.

These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from net income during fiscal 2024. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.', 'Working Capital (representing excess of current assets over current liabilities). We generated cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion in 2023 compared to $4.5 billion in 2022. Working capital decreased $1.2 billion, or 21%, during 2023 to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2023, due primarily to our accounts receivable and inventories decreasing $683.1 million, or 13%, compared to December 31, 2022, due to lower sales and inventory values in 2023. In addition, our $400 million 2.800% senior notes were recorded as current at December 31, 2023. Capital Investments. During 2023, we invested $1.7 billion in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our aluminum operations and steel operations segments, compared with $908.9 million invested during 2022. We are currently executing our plan to invest $2.7 billion in a new state-of-the-art low-carbon recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill with two supporting satellite recycled aluminum slab centers, which is planned to be funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. Related expenditures began in the third quarter of 2022 and are expected to continue through early 2025. Our liquidity of $3.5 billion and anticipated future operating cash flow generation is sufficient to provide for our planned 2024 capital requirements.', 'Cash from operations increased $31.0 billion to $118.5 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $6.2 billion to $37.8 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $5.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $3.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $2.0 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $74.3 billion to $97.0 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $67.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets and a $16.4 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.', 'The following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, excluding additional funds available to us through our Revolving Loan Facility: \nJuly 31,\t\t2024 vs. 2023\t\t2023 vs. 2022\n(In thousands)\t\t2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\t\tChange\t\t% Change\t\tChange\t\t% Change\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\t\t$\t1,514,111 \t\t\t$\t957,395 \t\t\t$\t1,384,236 \t\t\t$\t556,716 \t\t\t58.1 \t%\t\t$\t(426,841)\t\t\t(30.8)\t%\nWorking capital\t\t3,789,617 \t\t\t2,769,835 \t\t\t1,761,566 \t\t\t1,019,782 \t\t\t36.8 \t%\t\t1,008,269 \t\t\t57.2 \t%\n \nYear Ended July 31,\t\t2024 vs. 2023\t\t2023 vs. 2022\n(In thousands)\t\t2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\t\tChange\t\t% Change\t\tChange\t\t% Change\nOperating cash flows\t\t$\t1,472,564 \t\t\t$\t1,364,210 \t\t\t$\t1,176,683 \t\t\t$\t108,354 \t\t\t7.9 \t%\t\t$\t187,527 \t\t\t15.9 \t%\nInvesting cash flows\t\t(940,079)\t\t\t(1,892,049)\t\t\t(442,310)\t\t\t951,970 \t\t\t50.3 \t%\t\t(1,449,739)\t\t\t(327.8)\t%\nFinancing cash flows\t\t19,273 \t\t\t66,615 \t\t\t(382,693)\t\t\t(47,342)\t\t\t71.1 \t%\t\t449,308 \t\t\t117.4 \t%\nCapital expenditures, and acquisitions\t\t$\t(493,328)\t\t\t$\t(516,636)\t\t\t$\t(444,052)\t\t\t$\t23,308 \t\t\t4.5 \t%\t\t$\t(72,584)\t\t\t(16.3)\t%']",950.09033405222,I don’t know

67,67,c15faea8,Calculation of revenue per diluted share for CBRE Group in 2023.,"To calculate the revenue per diluted share for 2023, we first note that the reported revenue is $31,949 million and the weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per share is 312,550,942. Since the revenue figures are in millions, we can either convert the shares to millions or the revenue to actual dollars. Converting revenue: 31,949 million dollars = 31,949,000,000 dollars. Then, dividing: 31,949,000,000 dollars / 312,550,942 shares ≈ 102.2 dollars per share. Therefore, the revenue per diluted share for 2023 is approximately $102.20.","['CBRE GROUP, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nYear

In 2023, diluted earnings per share was driven primarily by the impact of higher operating income, an increase in interest expense, the unfavorable effects of a decrease in other income, and an increase in income from unconsolidated operations.

We foresee that our commitment to investing in our business for future product launches may lead to continued negative cash flows from operations in upcoming periods. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors.

69,69,0ce096b5,"Net margin trend for VRSN, including interest & non-op impacts over 3 yrs.","To assess the net profit margin for each year, we first calculate it by dividing net income by revenues. Based on the provided figures:

• 2021: Net income = $784.8 million, Revenue = $1,327.6 million → Margin = 784.8/1327.6 ≈ 59.1%
• 2022: Net income = $673.8 million, Revenue = $1,424.9 million → Margin = 673.8/1424.9 ≈ 47.3%
• 2023: Net income = $817.6 million, Revenue = $1,493.1 million → Margin = 817.6/1493.1 ≈ 54.8%

The net profit margin is a bottom‐line measure, which naturally reflects the impact of items that occur after operating income—including interest expenses, non‐operating income (or losses), and tax effects. In the operating income calculations, the company was profitable and largely consistent, but the following items then modified this performance:

1. Interest Expense: This is subtracted from operating income in all years. For example, while the interest expense remained relatively stable (around $75–83 million), it represents a fixed cost drain regardless of operating success. Its effect is constant and contributes to reducing net income relative to operating income.

2. Non-Operating Income: The impact from non-operating items has varied significantly. In 2021, a small loss (-$1.3 million) had almost no positive effect, whereas in 2022, a positive contribution of $12.4 million helped to partially offset expenses. Most notably, in 2023 non-operating income was much higher at $51.2 million, which substantially boosted net income.

3. Tax Effects: Another important factor is the tax expense (or benefit). For example, in 2021 the slight tax benefit (+$2.6 million) and in 2022 a much larger tax expense (around $206.4 million) further widened the differences in net income across the years, while in 2023 the tax expense was lower ($158.9 million).

What these observations show over the three-year period: 

• Between 2021 (margin ~59.1%) and 2022 (margin ~47.3%), the net margin fell significantly. This decline does not appear to be driven by a deterioration in operating income (which increased from $866.8 to $943.1 million) but rather by higher net expenses beyond operations (particularly the tax impact and absence of strong non-operating gains in 2021, compared to a small positive in 2022).

• In 2023, while revenues and operating income grew, the net margin improved to approximately 54.8%. This improvement is largely attributable to the substantial rise in non-operating income ($51.2 million), which more than offset the continuing interest expense and partly mitigated tax costs. 

Thus, the net profit margin neatly encapsulates the extent to which non-operating items—as well as interest and tax expenses—affect the bottom line. It highlights that even when operating performance is strong or improving, secondary factors like non-operating income and tax circumstances can lead to notable fluctuations in net profitability over time.","['VERISIGN, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions, except per share data)\n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nRevenues\t$\t1,493.1

70,70,e567f62b,Impact of litigation on profitability and cash flow for General Dynamics (GD) in the near to medium term.,"The provided disclosure information indicates that the outcomes of the Electric Boat-related litigation and the Sherman Act class action are uncertain, and a definitive quantitative impact on profitability and cash flows cannot be precisely calculated from the available data. However, the disclosures suggest that:

1. The Electric Boat quality system and False Claims Act investigations, as well as the related legal proceedings, might have a material impact on the results of operations if the outcomes are adverse. If losses were to be incurred—through fines, settlement costs, or remediation expenses—this could reduce profitability and put pressure on cash flows, particularly if large cash outlays are required in the near to medium term.

2. Similarly, the Sherman Act class action, which alleges suppression of compensation and seeks substantial damages, has the potential to negatively affect profitability if the court ruling (or settlement) requires large monetary payments or imposes injunctive measures that could impact operating expenditures. Again, while the potential exists for material adverse effects, the disclosure notes that the outcome remains uncertain.

3. Since the company is unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss for these cases, it indicates that management perceives these uncertainties as significant risks that may impact their financial condition and cash flows if the legal matters result in adverse outcomes.

Overall, while the current data does not allow for exact numeric estimates or detailed scenario analysis, it is clear that if the litigation results turn unfavorable, General Dynamics Corporation’s profitability could decline and its cash flows could be negatively impacted by potential legal liabilities, settlement payments, or associated remediation and compliance costs. Conversely, if the outcomes are favorable, there would be no material negative impact on financial results.","['In 2015, Electric Boat Corporation, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation, received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding an investigation of potential False Claims Act violations relating to alleged failures of Electric Boat’s quality system with respect to allegedly non-conforming parts purchased from a supplier. In 2016, Electric Boat was made aware that it is a defendant in a lawsuit related to this matter which had been filed under seal in U.S. district court. Also in 2016, the Suspending and Debarring Official for the U.S. Department of the Navy issued a show cause letter to Electric Boat requesting that Electric Boat respond to the official’s concerns regarding Electric Boat’s oversight and management with respect to its quality assurance systems for subcontractors and suppliers. Electric Boat responded to the show cause letter and engaged in discussions with the U.S. government.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Department of Justice declined to intervene in the qui tam action, noting that its investigation continues, and the court unsealed the relator’s complaint. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the relator filed a second amended complaint. In the third quarter of 2021, the court dismissed the relator’s complaint with prejudice. The relator appealed the dismissal of the complaint to the United States Court of Appeals, which was not granted. In the third quarter of 2023, the Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal of the relator’s complaint with prejudice. The relator thereafter filed a\n petition for rehearing with the Court of Appeals. Given the current status of these matters, we are unable to express a view regarding the ultimate outcome or, if the outcome is adverse, to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss.

The named plaintiffs purport to represent a class of individuals consisting of all naval architects and marine engineers employed by the shipyard and consultancy defendants, their predecessors, their subsidiaries and/or their related entities in the United States at any time since January 1, 2000. The plaintiffs allege that the conspiracy suppressed compensation paid to the putative class members, and the plaintiffs seek trebled monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, injunctive and other equitable relief. We are defending the matter.

We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation and applicable accounting rules. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future.', 'We are subject to routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Synopsys because of the defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nWe regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and as circumstances change, it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase, decrease or be eliminated.\nWe are not aware of any legal proceedings that would materially impact our business, operating results or financial condition.', 'In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.', 'We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such proceedings and claims is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation.', 'In the normal course of business, ADP is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, ADP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.', 'In addition to the above, in the ordinary course of our operations, we are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations, and proceedings, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, patent infringement claims, government investigations, labor and employment claims, breach of contract claims, tax, and other matters. Regardless of the outcome, these proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Although the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as litigation and events related thereto unfold; we currently do not believe that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.', ""The Company is unable to predict how any current or future investigations or litigation may be resolved or the long-term impact of any such resolution on its business. For example, competition and consumer-law-related investigations, legislation, or issues could result in private litigation and the Company is currently involved in such litigation. More immediate results could include, among other things, the imposition of fines, payment of damages, commitments to change certain business practices, or reputational damage, any of which could harm the Company's business, results of operations, brands, or competitive position.\n\nTax Matters"", 'We are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental, product liability, patent, contract, employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business. Including the environmental matter discussed below, after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows.', 'Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.']",631.442749989219,"General Dynamics treats litigation as a routine operating risk, and management currently expects existing matters—individually or in aggregate—to have no material effect on its profitability or cash flow in the near- to medium-term; absent an unexpected adverse ruling, impacts should be limited to normal defense costs and modest accrual adjustments."

We sell to our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary sales channel is through our direct sales force, which has a strong regional focus with local teams close to the customer, who are able to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by product line. See discussion below by segment.\nOilfield Services & Equipment\nThe OFSE segment designs and manufactures products and provides related services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of an asset, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning.\nBeyond its traditional oilfield concentration, OFSE is also expanding its capabilities and technology portfolio to meet the challenges of the energy transition, including focusing on new energy areas, such as geothermal and CCUS, strengthening its digital architecture, and addressing key energy market themes.\nThe OFSE segment is organized into four product lines.\n•Well Construction focuses on drilling and includes drilling services (directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, surface logging, and remote operations), drill bits (polycrystalline, roller cone, hybrid, and in-bit sensing), and drilling & completion fluids (emulsion-based, water-based, specialty, drill-in, and completion fluids; and waste management).\n•Completions, Intervention, & Measurements encompasses completions (wellbore construction, upper and lower completions, unconventional multistage completions, intelligent production systems, workover systems, and fishing and through-tubing services), pressure pumping (cementing, production enhancement, coiled tubing, and tubular running services), and wireline services (openhole logging services, cased-hole logging services, and perforating and drill stem-testing services).\n•Production Solutions spans artificial lift systems (electrical submersible pumping systems, surface pumping systems, rigless deployment systems, and sensors and gauges) and oilfield & industrial chemicals (upstream, downstream, and AquanessTM wholesale chemicals).\n•Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems includes subsea projects and services (subsea trees, controls, manifolds, wellheads, premium casing connectors, installation and commissioning, repairs and maintenance, well intervention, life-of-field solutions, and plug and abandonment), flexible pipe systems (subsea risers, subsea flowlines and jumpers, onshore reinforced thermoplastic pipe, and rehabilitation), and surface pressure control systems (surface trees and wellheads).\nThese product lines are supported by an OFSE digital group, which combines the segment\'s domain expertise with a deep understanding of digital technology to improve operational safety, performance, and sustainability. Reservoir analysis proficiencies are rooted in evaluation technologies, a team of reservoir experts, and software. Together, these capabilities provide customers with a greater understanding of the subsurface, enabling smoother, faster drilling and precise wellbore placement that can lead to improved recovery and project economics. OFSE also provides integrated well services and solutions to plan and execute projects ranging from well construction and production through well abandonment, in addition to integrated services and solutions for the subsea environment.\nOFSE customers include large integrated major and super-major oil and natural gas companies; U.S. and international independent oil and natural gas companies; national or state-owned oil and natural gas companies; engineering, procurement, and construction contractors; geothermal companies; and other oilfield services companies. OFSE believes that its principal competitive differentiators in the industries and markets it serves are the quality, efficiency, reliability, and availability of its products and services. A continued commitment to service delivery, HSE standards, technical proficiency, and competitive pricing is also a key factor in its success.\nOFSE products and services are sold in highly competitive markets. While OFSE may have contracts that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period ranging from two to four years, its services and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis. Most contracts cover pricing of the products and services, along with various limitations on liability, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use OFSE products and services. OFSE competitors include SLB and Halliburton (Well Construction; Completions, Intervention, & Measurements; Production Solutions; Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems); ChampionX (Production Solutions); and TechnipFMC, Aker Solutions, and NOV (Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems).\nIndustrial & Energy Technology\nThe IET segment combines a broad array of domain expertise, technologies, software, and services for energy customers including on-and offshore, LNG, pipeline and gas storage, refining, petrochemical, distributed gas, nuclear, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage, clean power and renewables.

The effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted.\nPrice, contract terms, availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service, including infrastructure availability and distribution efficiencies affect competition. We believe that our concentrated acreage positions and our access to both third-party and Company-owned gathering and pipeline infrastructure in our core operating areas, along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years, enhance our competitive position.', 'We compete for natural gas, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil volumes with other midstream companies, major integrated oil companies and independent exploration and production companies that have gathering and processing assets, fractionators, pipelines, terminals and storage facilities. The factors that typically affect our ability to compete for natural gas, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil volumes are:\n\n•quality of services provided;\n•producer drilling activity;\n•proceeds remitted and/or fees charged under our contracts;\n•proximity of our assets to natural gas, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil supply areas and markets;\n•proximity of our assets to alternative energy production;\n•location of our assets relative to those of our competitors;\n•efficiency and reliability of our operations;\n•receipt and delivery capabilities for natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil that exist in each pipeline system, plant, fractionator, terminal and storage location;\n•the petrochemical industry’s level of capacity utilization and feedstock requirements;\n•current and forward natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil prices; and\n•cost of and access to capital.', 'We are one of the world’s largest diversified energy services companies. Our services and products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services and products include: price; service delivery; health, safety, and environmental standards and practices; service quality; global talent retention; understanding the geological characteristics of the reservoir; product quality; warranty; and technical proficiency.', 'The transaction price of the performance obligations for our natural gas customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on natural gas delivered each month.', 'Crude Oil and Condensate. EOG sells its crude oil and condensate production at the wellhead or further downstream at a contractually-specified delivery point. Revenue is recognized when control transfers to the customer based on contract terms which reflect prevailing market prices. Any costs incurred prior to the transfer of control, such as gathering and transportation, are recognized as Operating Expenses.']",1056.2518340302631,"Coterra’s core operations employ 894 people, 564 salaried and 330 hourly, making the mix roughly 63 % salaried / 37 % hourly.  
GasSearch Drilling Services (GDS) employs 189 people, 16 salaried and 173 hourly, or about 9 % salaried / 91 % hourly.  
Thus, the parent’s workforce is salary-heavy—reflecting higher fixed overhead—while GDS is almost entirely hourly, giving that service arm a far more variable, flexible cost structure for water-hauling and site-prep work."

revolving credit facility. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and availability under our credit facilities, is our primary source of liquidity for funding business requirements. Our funding requirements include capital expenditures for announced manufacturing expansions in the Netherlands and Argentina, as well as capital investments to upgrade information systems and ERP infrastructure, working capital requirements, and dividends. These expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, future economic conditions, supply chain constraints for equipment, and our regulatory compliance requirements. At May 26, 2024, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $402.7 million.\nCash Flows\nBelow is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities:\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n(in millions)\t\t2024\t\t2023\nNet cash flows provided by (used for):\t\t\t\t\nOperating activities\t\t$\t798.2 \t\t\t$\t761.7 \t\nInvesting activities\t\t(984.1)\t\t\t(1,340.9)\t\nFinancing activities\t\t(48.0)\t\t\t340.8 \t\n(233.9)\t\t\t(238.4)\t\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\t\t0.5 \t\t\t18.2 \t\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\t\t(233.4)\t\t\t(220.2)\t\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\t\t304.8 \t\t\t525.0 \t\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\t\t$\t71.4 \t\t\t$\t304.8 \t\n \nOperating Activities\nDuring fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities increased $36.5 million to $798.2 million, compared to $761.7 million for fiscal 2023. The increase included a $257.9 million increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash income and expenses, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $221.4 million primarily related to changes in performance-based compensation and benefit accruals and increased inventory balances due to cost inflation, as well as lower than expected sales volumes in the second half of the year related to the ERP transition and soft restaurant traffic trends in North America and other key international markets. See “Results of Operations” in this MD&A for more information related to the increase in income from operations.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $984.1 million of cash in fiscal 2024, compared with $1,340.9 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease primarily relates to $610.4 million of cash used to purchase the remaining equity interest in LW EMEA and an additional 40% equity interest in LWAMSA during fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 included expenditures to expand our french fry and chopped and formed capacity and other facility modernization efforts in American Falls, Idaho, which became operational in May 2024; the construction of a greenfield french fry processing facility in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia, China, which became operational in November 2023; and expenditures for the construction of french fry processing facilities in Kruiningen, the Netherlands and Mar del Plata, Argentina which are scheduled to be completed in fall 2024 and mid-calendar year 2025, respectively.\nWe expect to use approximately $850 million, excluding acquisitions, if any, for investing activities, in fiscal 2025 as we continue construction of our capacity expansion efforts in the Netherlands and Argentina, as well as capital investments to upgrade our information systems and ERP infrastructure.', ""Years Ended December 31,\n2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nOPERATING REVENUES\t\t$\t28,114 \t\t\t$\t20,956 \t\t\t$\t17,069 \t\nOPERATING EXPENSES\t\t \t\t \t\t \nFuel, purchased power and interchange\t\t5,457 \t\t\t6,389 \t\t\t4,527 \t\nOther operations and maintenance\t\t4,681 \t\t\t4,428 \t\t\t3,981 \t\nDepreciation and amortization\t\t5,879 \t\t\t4,503 \t\t\t3,924 \t\nTaxes other than income taxes and other – net\t\t2,265 \t\t\t2,077 \t\t\t1,801 \t\nTotal operating expenses – net\t\t18,282 \t\t\t17,397 \t\t\t14,233 \t\nGAINS ON DISPOSAL OF BUSINESSES/ASSETS – NET\t\t405 \t\t\t522 \t\t\t77 \t\nOPERATING INCOME\t\t10,237 \t\t\t4,081 \t\t\t2,913 \t\nOTHER INCOME (DEDUCTIONS)\t\t \t\t \t\t \nInterest expense\t\t(3,324)\t\t\t(585)\t\t\t(1,270)\t\nEquity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees\t\t(648)\t\t\t203 \t\t\t666 \t\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\t\t161 \t\t\t112 \t\t\t142 \t\nGains on disposal of investments and other property – net\n125 \t\t\t80 \t\t\t70 \t\nChange in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net\t\t159 \t\t\t(461)\t\t\t267 \t\nOther net periodic benefit income\t\t245 \t\t\t202 \t\t\t257 \t\nOther – net\t\t333 \t\t\t200 \t\t\t130 \t\nTotal other income (deductions) – net\t\t(2,949)\t\t\t(249)\t\t\t262 \t\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\t\t7,288 \t\t\t3,832 \t\t\t3,175 \t\nINCOME TAXES\t\t1,006 \t\t\t586 \t\t\t348 \t\nNET INCOME\t\t6,282 \t\t\t3,246 \t\t\t2,827 \t\nNET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\t\t1,028 \t\t\t901 \t\t\t746 \t\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEE\t\t$\t7,310 \t\t\t$\t4,147 \t\t\t$\t3,573 \t\nEarnings per share attributable to NEE:\t\t \t\t \t\t \nBasic\t\t$\t3.61 \t\t\t$\t2.10 \t\t\t$\t1.82 \t\nAssuming dilution\t\t$\t3.60 \t\t\t$\t2.10 \t\t\t$\t1.81"", 'As a result of the items above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $761.4 million, or 40% of revenues less cost of revenues, compared to $235.0 million, or 14% of revenues less cost of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $526.4 million, or 224%.\n\nSegment Operating Results', 'NET INCOME\tYear Ended June 30,\t\t\n%\nChange\n \t2024\t\t2023\t\nNet income\t$\t381,816 \t\t\t$\t366,646 \t\t\t4.1%\nDiluted earnings per share\t$\t5.23 \t\t\t$\t5.02 \t\t\t4.2%\n \nNet income grew 4.1% to $381,816, or $5.23 per diluted share, in fiscal 2024 from $366,646, or $5.02 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023.

On August 7, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the extension of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2024 and the repurchase of up to an additional 100,000,000 shares under the extended program.', 'In 2005, shareholders approved the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 6 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. In 2008, shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 10.5 million and in 2010, shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 17.5 million. In 2015, shareholders approved the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 13 million shares. Approximately 6 million of these shares were shares that were currently available under the 2005 plan and were incorporated into the 2015 Plan upon approval by\nshareholders. In 2022, shareholders approved the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 12 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. The 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan replaced the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and none of the shares that remain available under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan are available for issuance under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nAwards under Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, strategic performance restricted stock/units, time-lapse restricted stock/units, special performance restricted stock/units, free cash flow (FCF) performance restricted stock/units and unrestricted stock. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goal (EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units), measured over a three-year period. A recipient of EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units earned a total award of either 0% or 100% of the initial grant. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics, net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a three-year period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of FCF performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow (defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities) compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. An annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. Performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. A recipient of FCF performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. In addition, we may issue special grants of restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October.\nStock options are granted on a selective basis under the Long-Term Incentive Plans. The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a three-year period. In 2019, we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. We last issued stock options in 2019.\nIn 2024, we issued time-lapse restricted stock units, unrestricted stock, TSR performance restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units. We last issued FCF performance restricted stock units in 2019, EPS performance restricted stock units in 2018, strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015.\nIn connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition, we issued 1.721 million time-lapse restricted stock units (Replacement units) in exchange for certain Sovos Brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. The Replacement units are subject to the same terms and conditions of the original Sovos Brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. Certain Replacement units were subject to accelerated vesting. The Replacement units have a total fair value of $74 million based on the quoted price of our stock on the acquisition date. The portion of Replacement units attributed to pre-combination service was $42 million, which was accounted for as part of consideration transferred and was recorded in Additional Paid-in Capital in our Consolidated Statements of Equity. See Note 3 for additional information. The portion of the Replacement units attributable to post-combination service will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period. Also in connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition in 2024, our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goals for the EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were revised to equitably adjust for the impact of completed acquisitions and divestitures that were not contemplated at the time of approval of the original targets.', ""['n o t e s t o c o n s o l i d a t e d f i n a n c i a l s t a t e m e n t s ( continued ) ace limited and subsidiaries the following table shows changes in the company 2019s stock options for the years ended december 31 , 2008 , 2007 , and number of options weighted average exercise price .'] number of options weightedaverageexercise price options outstanding december 31 2005 12643761 $ 36.53 granted 1505215 $ 56.29 exercised -1982560 ( 1982560 ) $ 33.69 forfeited -413895 ( 413895 ) $ 39.71 options outstanding december 31 2006 11752521 $ 39.43 granted 1549091 $ 56.17 exercised -1830004 ( 1830004 ) $ 35.73 forfeited -200793 ( 200793 ) $ 51.66 options outstanding december 31 2007 11270815 $ 42.12 granted 1612507 $ 60.17 exercised -2650733 ( 2650733 ) $ 36.25 forfeited -309026 ( 309026 ) $ 54.31 options outstanding december 31 2008 9923563 $ 46.24 ['the weighted-average remaining contractual term was 5.8 years for the stock options outstanding and 4.6 years for the stock options exercisable at december 31 , 2008 .', 'the total intrinsic value was approximately $ 66 million for stock options out- standing and $ 81 million for stock options exercisable at december 31 , 2008 .', 'the weighted-average fair value for the stock options granted for the year ended december 31 , 2008 was $ 17.60 .', 'the total intrinsic value for stock options exercised dur- ing the years ended december 31 , 2008 , 2007 , and 2006 , was approximately $ 54 million , $ 44 million , and $ 43 million , respectively .', 'the amount of cash received during the year ended december 31 , 2008 , from the exercise of stock options was $ 97 million .', 'restricted stock the company 2019s 2004 ltip also provides for grants of restricted stock .', 'the company generally grants restricted stock with a 4-year vesting period , based on a graded vesting schedule .', 'the restricted stock is granted at market close price on the date of grant .', 'included in the company 2019s share-based compensation expense in the year ended december 31 , 2008 , is a portion of the cost related to the unvested restricted stock granted in the years 2004 to 2008. .']"", 'On September 22, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a 320 million share increase in our stock repurchase program, bringing the total current authorization to 784 million shares.

81,81,748aaa96,Env. lib. impact on long-term profit & cash flow for GE.,"The available data provides insight into the reserves GE has set aside for its environmental, health, and safety liabilities (approximately $2,465 million at December 31, 2023) and historical annual expenditures (ranging from $181 million in 2021 to $260 million in 2023, with an expected annual outlay of about $200 million for 2024 and 2025). This indicates that GE anticipates ongoing environmental remediation and related costs. However, the narrative also emphasizes uncertainties in future outcomes—such as potential changes in regulatory interpretations, litigation outcomes, and additional unforeseen liabilities—that might push actual costs beyond the current reserves.

Consequently, if future environmental liabilities (including those related to projects like the Housatonic River cleanup) materialize at a higher-than-expected level, GE’s long‐term profitability could be negatively impacted. Specifically, larger-than-anticipated cash disbursements or settlements could: 
• Increase operating expenses, thereby reducing operating margins and net income.
• Force additional cash outflows beyond expected yearly expenditures, putting pressure on free cash flow available for reinvestment, debt reduction, or dividend payments.
• Potentially lead to future non-cash charge adjustments in the financial statements, affecting earnings metrics and valuation multiples.

In summary, while GE’s current reserves and historical expenditures suggest that planned liabilities are being managed, the inherent uncertainties in environmental litigation and remediation efforts mean that any substantial increases in these liabilities could materially strain cash flow and erode profitability over the long term.","[""Alstom legacy legal matters. In 2015, we acquired the Steam Power, Renewables and Grid businesses from Alstom, which prior to our acquisition were the subject of significant cases involving anti-competitive activities and improper payments. We had reserves of $393 million and $455 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for legal and compliance matters related to the legacy business practices that were the subject of cases in various jurisdictions. Allegations in these cases relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or improper payments in the pre-acquisition period as the source of legal violations or damages. Given the significant litigation and compliance activity related to these matters and our ongoing efforts to resolve them, it is difficult to assess whether the disbursements will ultimately be consistent with the reserve established. The estimation of this reserve may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations of this nature, and at this time we are unable to develop a meaningful estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond the amount of this reserve. Factors that can affect the ultimate amount of losses associated with these and related matters include the way cooperation is assessed and valued, prosecutorial discretion in the determination of damages, formulas for determining disgorgement, fines or penalties, the duration and amount of legal and investigative resources applied, political and social influences within each jurisdiction, and tax consequences of any settlements or previous deductions, among other considerations. Actual losses arising from claims in these and related matters could exceed the amount provided.\n\nShareholder and related lawsuits. Since November 2017, several putative shareholder class actions under the federal securities laws were filed against GE and certain affiliated individuals and consolidated into a single action currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Hachem case, also referred to as the Sjunde AP-Fonden case). The complaint against defendants GE and current and former GE executive officers alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 related to insurance reserves and accounting for long-term service agreements and seeks damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired GE stock between February 27, 2013 and January 23, 2018. GE filed a motion to dismiss in December 2019. In January 2021, the court granted the motion to dismiss as to the majority of the claims. Specifically, the court dismissed all claims related to insurance reserves, as well as all claims related to accounting for long-term service agreements, with the exception of certain claims about historic disclosures related to factoring in the Power business that survive as to GE and its former CFO Jeffrey S. Bornstein. All other individual defendants have been dismissed from the case. In April 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification for shareholders who acquired stock between February 26, 2016 and January 23, 2018. In September 2022, GE filed a motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' remaining claims. In September 2023, the court denied GE’s motion for summary judgment, except as to claims arising from disclosures made between November 2017 and January 2018.\n\nSince February 2018, multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against current and former GE executive officers and members of GE’s Board of Directors and GE (as nominal defendant). These lawsuits have alleged violations of securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control and gross mismanagement, although the specific matters underlying the allegations in the lawsuits have varied. Two shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently pending: the Lindsey and Priest/Tola cases, which were filed in New York state court. The allegations in these two cases relate to substantially the same facts as those underlying the Sjunde AP-Fonden case. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and improvements in GE’s corporate governance and internal procedures. The Lindsey case has been stayed by agreement of the parties, and GE filed a motion to dismiss the Priest/Tola complaint in March 2021.\n\nIn July 2018, a putative class action (the Mahar case) was filed in New York state court naming as defendants GE, former GE executive officers, a former member of GE’s Board of Directors and KPMG. It alleged violations of Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 based on alleged misstatements related to insurance reserves and performance of GE’s business segments in GE Stock Direct Plan registration statements and documents incorporated therein by reference and seeks damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired GE stock between July 20, 2015 and July 19, 2018 through the GE Stock Direct Plan. In February 2019, this case was dismissed. In April 2019, GE filed a motion to dismiss. In October 2019, the court denied GE's motion to dismiss and stayed the case pending the outcome of the Sjunde AP-Fonden case. In November 2019, the plaintiffs moved to re-argue to challenge the stay, and GE cross-moved to re-argue the denial of the motion to dismiss and filed a notice of appeal. The court denied both motions for re-argument, and in November 2020, the Appellate Division First Department affirmed the court's denial of GE's motion to dismiss. In January 2021, GE filed a motion for leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, and that motion was denied in March 2021.\n\nGE Retirement Savings Plan class actions. In 2017, four putative class action lawsuits were filed regarding the oversight of the GE RSP, and those class actions were consolidated into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The consolidated complaint named as defendants GE, GE Asset Management, current and former GE and GE Asset Management executive officers and employees who served on fiduciary bodies responsible for aspects of the GE RSP during the class period. Like similar lawsuits that were brought against other companies in recent years, this action alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in their oversight of the GE RSP, principally by retaining five proprietary funds that plaintiffs alleged were underperforming as investment options for plan participants and by charging higher management fees than some alternative funds. The plaintiffs sought unspecified damages on behalf of a class of GE RSP participants and beneficiaries from September 26, 2011 through the date of any judgment. In August and December 2018, the court issued orders dismissing one count of the complaint and denying GE's motion to dismiss the remaining counts. In September 2022, both GE and the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims. In September 2023, GE executed a class action settlement with plaintiffs in the amount of $61 million, which the court preliminarily approved in October 2023 with a hearing on final approval scheduled for March 2024. Net of insurance contributions, this had an immaterial financial impact that GE recognized in its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n Bank BPH. As previously reported, Bank BPH, along with other Polish banks, has been subject to ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of floating rate residential mortgage loans, with cases brought by individual borrowers seeking relief related to their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans in various courts throughout Poland. For a number of years, GE has observed an increase in the total number of lawsuits being brought against Bank BPH and other banks in Poland by current and former borrowers, and we expect this to continue in future reporting periods. As previously reported, GE and Bank BPH approved the adoption of a settlement program and recorded an additional charge of $1,014 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH as of December 31, 2023 was $2,669 million.\n\nThe estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH as of December 31, 2023 accounts for the costs of payments to borrowers who we estimate will participate in the settlement program, as well as estimates for the results of litigation with other borrowers, which in either case can exceed the value of the current loan balance. This estimate represents our best estimate of the total losses we expect to incur over time. However, there are a number of factors that could affect the estimate in the future, including: potentially significant judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court, including a ruling by the ECJ in June 2023 that could significantly increase the cost to banks of loans invalidated by Polish courts and encourage more borrower lawsuits; the impact of any such decisions or resolutions on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases; the receptivity of borrowers over time to Bank BPH’s settlement program; the number of active and inactive borrowers who sue Bank BPH; the ability of Bank BPH to recover from borrowers the original principal amount of loans invalidated by Polish courts; and the impact of potential future legislation in Poland relating to foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans. While we are unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses beyond the amount currently recorded, future changes related to any of the foregoing or in Bank BPH’s settlement approach, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators, legislators or other governmental authorities (including consumer protection regulators), could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We record reserves for obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup described below, and for additional liabilities we expect to incur in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged exposure by workers and others to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims were $2,465 million and $2,415 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nIn 2000, GE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into a consent decree relating to PCB cleanup of the Housatonic River in Massachusetts. In October 2016, the EPA issued its final decision pursuant to the consent decree, which GE and several other interested parties appealed to the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB). The EAB issued its decision in January 2018, affirming parts of the EPA’s decision and granting relief to GE on certain significant elements of its challenge. The EAB remanded the decision back to the EPA to address those elements and reissue a revised final remedy, and the EPA convened a mediation process with GE and interested stakeholders. In February 2020, the EPA announced an agreement between the EPA and many of the mediation stakeholders, including GE, concerning a revised Housatonic River remedy. In March 2021, two local environmental advocacy groups filed a joint petition to the EAB challenging portions of the revised permit; in February 2022, the EAB denied the petition, and the permit became effective in March 2022. In May 2022, the two environmental advocacy groups petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to review the EPA’s final permit. The Court's denial of this petition in July 2023 was not appealed, concluding these proceedings on the EPA’s remedy. As of December 31, 2023, and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances, GE believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with the EPA's final remedy.\n\nExpenditures for site remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $260 million, $220 million and $181 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately $200 million in both 2024 and 2025.""]",,,FinDER,Non-numerical,"[""Alstom legacy legal matters. In 2015, we acquired the Steam Power, Renewables and Grid businesses from Alstom, which prior to our acquisition were the subject of significant cases involving anti-competitive activities and improper payments. We had reserves of $393 million and $455 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for legal and compliance matters related to the legacy business practices that were the subject of cases in various jurisdictions. Allegations in these cases relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or improper payments in the pre-acquisition period as the source of legal violations or damages. Given the significant litigation and compliance activity related to these matters and our ongoing efforts to resolve them, it is difficult to assess whether the disbursements will ultimately be consistent with the reserve established. The estimation of this reserve may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations of this nature, and at this time we are unable to develop a meaningful estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond the amount of this reserve. Factors that can affect the ultimate amount of losses associated with these and related matters include the way cooperation is assessed and valued, prosecutorial discretion in the determination of damages, formulas for determining disgorgement, fines or penalties, the duration and amount of legal and investigative resources applied, political and social influences within each jurisdiction, and tax consequences of any settlements or previous deductions, among other considerations. Actual losses arising from claims in these and related matters could exceed the amount provided.\n\nShareholder and related lawsuits. Since November 2017, several putative shareholder class actions under the federal securities laws were filed against GE and certain affiliated individuals and consolidated into a single action currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Hachem case, also referred to as the Sjunde AP-Fonden case). The complaint against defendants GE and current and former GE executive officers alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 related to insurance reserves and accounting for long-term service agreements and seeks damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired GE stock between February 27, 2013 and January 23, 2018. GE filed a motion to dismiss in December 2019. In January 2021, the court granted the motion to dismiss as to the majority of the claims. Specifically, the court dismissed all claims related to insurance reserves, as well as all claims related to accounting for long-term service agreements, with the exception of certain claims about historic disclosures related to factoring in the Power business that survive as to GE and its former CFO Jeffrey S. Bornstein. All other individual defendants have been dismissed from the case. In April 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification for shareholders who acquired stock between February 26, 2016 and January 23, 2018. In September 2022, GE filed a motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' remaining claims. In September 2023, the court denied GE’s motion for summary judgment, except as to claims arising from disclosures made between November 2017 and January 2018.\n\nSince February 2018, multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against current and former GE executive officers and members of GE’s Board of Directors and GE (as nominal defendant). These lawsuits have alleged violations of securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control and gross mismanagement, although the specific matters underlying the allegations in the lawsuits have varied. Two shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently pending: the Lindsey and Priest/Tola cases, which were filed in New York state court. The allegations in these two cases relate to substantially the same facts as those underlying the Sjunde AP-Fonden case. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and improvements in GE’s corporate governance and internal procedures. The Lindsey case has been stayed by agreement of the parties, and GE filed a motion to dismiss the Priest/Tola complaint in March 2021.\n\nIn July 2018, a putative class action (the Mahar case) was filed in New York state court naming as defendants GE, former GE executive officers, a former member of GE’s Board of Directors and KPMG. It alleged violations of Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 based on alleged misstatements related to insurance reserves and performance of GE’s business segments in GE Stock Direct Plan registration statements and documents incorporated therein by reference and seeks damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired GE stock between July 20, 2015 and July 19, 2018 through the GE Stock Direct Plan. In February 2019, this case was dismissed. In April 2019, GE filed a motion to dismiss. In October 2019, the court denied GE's motion to dismiss and stayed the case pending the outcome of the Sjunde AP-Fonden case. In November 2019, the plaintiffs moved to re-argue to challenge the stay, and GE cross-moved to re-argue the denial of the motion to dismiss and filed a notice of appeal. The court denied both motions for re-argument, and in November 2020, the Appellate Division First Department affirmed the court's denial of GE's motion to dismiss. In January 2021, GE filed a motion for leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, and that motion was denied in March 2021.\n\nGE Retirement Savings Plan class actions. In 2017, four putative class action lawsuits were filed regarding the oversight of the GE RSP, and those class actions were consolidated into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The consolidated complaint named as defendants GE, GE Asset Management, current and former GE and GE Asset Management executive officers and employees who served on fiduciary bodies responsible for aspects of the GE RSP during the class period. Like similar lawsuits that were brought against other companies in recent years, this action alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in their oversight of the GE RSP, principally by retaining five proprietary funds that plaintiffs alleged were underperforming as investment options for plan participants and by charging higher management fees than some alternative funds. The plaintiffs sought unspecified damages on behalf of a class of GE RSP participants and beneficiaries from September 26, 2011 through the date of any judgment. In August and December 2018, the court issued orders dismissing one count of the complaint and denying GE's motion to dismiss the remaining counts. In September 2022, both GE and the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims. In September 2023, GE executed a class action settlement with plaintiffs in the amount of $61 million, which the court preliminarily approved in October 2023 with a hearing on final approval scheduled for March 2024. Net of insurance contributions, this had an immaterial financial impact that GE recognized in its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n Bank BPH. As previously reported, Bank BPH, along with other Polish banks, has been subject to ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of floating rate residential mortgage loans, with cases brought by individual borrowers seeking relief related to their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans in various courts throughout Poland. For a number of years, GE has observed an increase in the total number of lawsuits being brought against Bank BPH and other banks in Poland by current and former borrowers, and we expect this to continue in future reporting periods. As previously reported, GE and Bank BPH approved the adoption of a settlement program and recorded an additional charge of $1,014 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH as of December 31, 2023 was $2,669 million.\n\nThe estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH as of December 31, 2023 accounts for the costs of payments to borrowers who we estimate will participate in the settlement program, as well as estimates for the results of litigation with other borrowers, which in either case can exceed the value of the current loan balance. This estimate represents our best estimate of the total losses we expect to incur over time. However, there are a number of factors that could affect the estimate in the future, including: potentially significant judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court, including a ruling by the ECJ in June 2023 that could significantly increase the cost to banks of loans invalidated by Polish courts and encourage more borrower lawsuits; the impact of any such decisions or resolutions on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases; the receptivity of borrowers over time to Bank BPH’s settlement program; the number of active and inactive borrowers who sue Bank BPH; the ability of Bank BPH to recover from borrowers the original principal amount of loans invalidated by Polish courts; and the impact of potential future legislation in Poland relating to foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans. While we are unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses beyond the amount currently recorded, future changes related to any of the foregoing or in Bank BPH’s settlement approach, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators, legislators or other governmental authorities (including consumer protection regulators), could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We record reserves for obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup described below, and for additional liabilities we expect to incur in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged exposure by workers and others to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims were $2,465 million and $2,415 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nIn 2000, GE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into a consent decree relating to PCB cleanup of the Housatonic River in Massachusetts. In October 2016, the EPA issued its final decision pursuant to the consent decree, which GE and several other interested parties appealed to the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB). The EAB issued its decision in January 2018, affirming parts of the EPA’s decision and granting relief to GE on certain significant elements of its challenge. The EAB remanded the decision back to the EPA to address those elements and reissue a revised final remedy, and the EPA convened a mediation process with GE and interested stakeholders. In February 2020, the EPA announced an agreement between the EPA and many of the mediation stakeholders, including GE, concerning a revised Housatonic River remedy. In March 2021, two local environmental advocacy groups filed a joint petition to the EAB challenging portions of the revised permit; in February 2022, the EAB denied the petition, and the permit became effective in March 2022. In May 2022, the two environmental advocacy groups petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to review the EPA’s final permit. The Court's denial of this petition in July 2023 was not appealed, concluding these proceedings on the EPA’s remedy. As of December 31, 2023, and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances, GE believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with the EPA's final remedy.\n\nExpenditures for site remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $260 million, $220 million and $181 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately $200 million in both 2024 and 2025.""]",748aaa96,True,"['Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. For further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.', 'As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments from continuing operations, in an aggregate amount of $5.1 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our material cash requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange volatility, elevated interest rates and global economic uncertainty have caused material disruptions in both U.S. and international financial markets and economies and are uncertain in duration. The impact of these events has increased, and may continue to increase, our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The future impact of these events cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure that we will have access to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experience other liquidity issues going forward.', 'We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results.\nAs of December 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.\nThe TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of December 30, 2023, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $579 million of this liability in 2024. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.\nSupply chain financing arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements.\nFurthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.\nThe table below summarizes our cash activity: \n2023\t\t2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\t$\t13,442 \t\t\t$\t10,811 \t\nNet cash used for investing activities\t$\t(5,495)\t\t\t$\t(2,430)\t\nNet cash used for financing activities\t$\t(3,009)\t\t\t$\t(8,523)', 'Historically, we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations, public offerings of common stock, equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions, and debt financing. Our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of service fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales. We expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business. In addition to our stock repurchase program, we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash balances and our cash flows from operations. For further detail, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 – Long-Term Debt and Note 12 — Stockholders’ Equity and under the subheading “Credit Agreement” below.\n\nOur business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently, the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair. During the winter months, most of our facilities process 5% to 20% more vehicles than at other times of the year. Severe weather events, including but not limited to tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and hailstorms, can also impact our volumes. These increased volumes require the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business.', 'In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees. We also provide a guarantee to GE Capital on behalf of a customer who entered into a financing arrangement with GE Capital. Total off-balance sheet arrangements were approximately $5.1 billion at December 31, 2023. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. As of December 31, 2023, none of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also had commitments outstanding for purchase obligations for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2028 of $1,871 million, $366 million, $220 million, $215 million and $47 million, respectively, and $27 million in the aggregate thereafter.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects primarily in our OFSE segment. Under such arrangements, each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work, and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed. The failure or inability, financially or otherwise, of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us. These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project, liquidated damages or contract disputes.', 'Liquidity and capital resources are primarily impacted by our operating activities, proceeds from issuance of our investment grade debt, as well as cash used on stock repurchases, real estate purchases and other capital expenditures, investments in various companies and business acquisitions.\nIn recent years, we have received significant capital resources from our billings to customers, issuance of investment grade debt and, to some extent, from the exercise of stock options by our employees. Additional increases in billings may depend on a number of factors, including demand for and availability of our products and services, competition, pricing actions, market or industry changes, macroeconomic events such as rising inflation and interest rates, economic strength, supply chain capacity and disruptions, international conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and our ability to execute. We expect proceeds from the exercise of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units and performance stock units versus stock options granted to our employees and to vary based on our share price. We expect our cash tax payments to increase as a result of a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, other tax law changes and our expected growth.', 'New technology and alternative energy sources could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nAdvances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in loss of market share and customers, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. These changes in technology, including micro-grids and advances in energy or battery storage, could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize energy, which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. Economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs typically can lead to the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency and self-generation by customers. Additionally, in response to risks posed by climate change, we may need to make investments in our system including upgrades or retrofits to meet enhanced design criteria, which can incur additional costs over conventional solutions.\n\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for equipment, materials, and services and we outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance or inability to fulfill obligations by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.', 'ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations.

83,83,8892002b,Deferred asset mvmt related to AMT has a notable impact on earnings & cash flow.,"The balance sheet shows that both the deferred tax asset and the deferred rent asset have increased from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 ($129.2 million to $179.1 million for the deferred tax asset and $3,039.1 million to $3,521.8 million for the deferred rent asset). Although we do not have the detailed income statement or comprehensive notes that would explain the underlying transactions, we can provide a conceptual explanation of how changes in these deferred assets affect reported earnings and future cash flow projections:

1. Deferred Tax Asset – Impact on Reported Earnings and Future Cash Flows:
   • The deferred tax asset represents temporary differences between accounting income and taxable income that are expected to reduce taxable income in the future. An increase (in this case, a roughly $50 million increase) is typically recorded as a component in the tax expense calculation. In periods when these deferred items are recognized, they may reduce the effective tax expense, thereby increasing reported net income even though no cash tax benefit has been received yet.
   • In future periods, as the temporary differences reverse, the company will realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets in the form of lower cash tax payments. Thus, while the movement affects reported earnings (via adjustments in tax expense), it does not immediately impact cash flows but improves future cash flow projections by reducing future tax outlays.

2. Deferred Rent Asset – Impact on Reported Earnings and Future Cash Flows:
   • The deferred rent asset generally arises from differences in the timing of rent expense recognition between cash payment and GAAP reporting (often due to lease accounting standards). An increase in the deferred rent asset indicates that a larger portion of rent payments has been capitalized as an asset rather than immediately expensed.
   • For reported earnings, this means that the current period’s expense is lower (since some of the cost is deferred), potentially leading to higher reported earnings. However, the expense will be recognized in future periods when the deferred balance is amortized, causing future earnings to reflect higher expenses. 
   • Since these are noncash adjustments, the current cash flow is not affected. The future cash flow projections improve in the near term because the actual cash outlay for rent was higher than the expense recognized under GAAP, but over time the expense catch-up will occur as the deferred rent asset is amortized.

In summary, the movement in deferred tax assets improves net income in the period of recognition by reducing the tax expense, although it represents a timing difference – meaning the tax benefit is cash-neutral until the temporary differences reverse. Similarly, the increase in the deferred rent asset defers rent-related expense cost recognition, leading to a timing difference where cash payments occur in advance of expense recognition. Therefore, while these deferred asset movements affect the timing of expense recognition (and hence reported earnings), they do not represent immediate changes in cash flow. Instead, they imply that future cash flows will be affected as the temporary differences reverse and deferred expenses are recognized.","['AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except share count and per share data)  \nDecember 31, 2023\t\tDecember 31, 2022\nASSETS\t\t\t\t\nCURRENT ASSETS:\t\t\t\t\nCash and cash equivalents\t\t$\t1,973.3 \t\t\t$\t2,028.4 \t\nRestricted cash\t\t120.1 \t\t\t112.3 \t\nAccounts receivable, net\t\t669.7 \t\t\t758.3 \t\nPrepaid and other current assets\t\t946.9 \t\t\t723.3 \t\nTotal current assets\t\t3,710.0 \t\t\t3,622.3 \t\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, net\t\t19,788.8 \t\t\t19,998.3 \t\nGOODWILL\t\t12,639.0 \t\t\t12,956.7 \t\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, net\t\t16,520.7 \t\t\t17,983.3 \t\nDEFERRED TAX ASSET\t\t179.1 \t\t\t129.2 \t\nDEFERRED RENT ASSET\t\t3,521.8 \t\t\t3,039.1 \t\nRIGHT-OF-USE ASSET\t\t8,878.8 \t\t\t8,918.9 \t\nNOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS\t\t789.4 \t\t\t546.7 \t\nTOTAL\t\t$\t66,027.6 \t\t\t$\t67,194.5 \t\nLIABILITIES\t\t\t\t\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\t\t\t\t\nAccounts payable\t\t$\t258.7 \t\t\t$\t218.6 \t\nAccrued expenses\t\t1,280.6 \t\t\t1,344.2 \t\nDistributions payable\t\t906.2 \t\t\t745.3 \t\nAccrued interest\t\t387.0 \t\t\t261.0 \t\nCurrent portion of operating lease liability\t\t794.6 \t\t\t788.9 \t\nCurrent portion of long-term obligations\t\t3,187.5 \t\t\t4,514.2 \t\nUnearned revenue\t\t434.7 \t\t\t439.7 \t\nTotal current liabilities\t\t7,249.3 \t\t\t8,311.9 \t\nLONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS\t\t35,734.0 \t\t\t34,156.0 \t\nOPERATING LEASE LIABILITY\t\t7,438.7 \t\t\t7,591.9 \t\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\t\t2,158.2 \t\t\t2,047.4 \t\nDEFERRED TAX LIABILITY\t\t1,361.4 \t\t\t1,492.0 \t\nOTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES\t\t1,220.6 \t\t\t1,186.8 \t\nTotal liabilities\t\t55,162.2 \t\t\t54,786.0 \t\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\t\t\t\t\nEQUITY (shares in thousands):\t\t\t\t\nCommon stock: $0.01 par value;

The amounts are mostly subject to refunds for cancellations.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $690 million as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act""), which included $515 million reported as ""Long-term U.S. transition tax liability"" and $175 million included in ""Accrued expenses and other current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability will be paid over the next three years. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us.', 'Material cash requirements primarily consist of debt obligations and related interest payments, along with lease obligations. Refer to the Debt footnote on page 86 and Leases footnote on page 91 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were approximately $470.2 million. Refer to Income Taxes footnote on page 89 of this Form 10-K for more information. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, as this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately $63.1 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled. We do not expect reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties.', 'The decrease in cash outflows for purchases of real estate and other assets was driven by the nature of the real estate assets acquired during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired two apartment communities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired two apartment communities, and closed on the pre-purchase of a multifamily development community. The increase in cash outflows for capital improvements and other was primarily driven by increased capital spend relating to our revenue enhancing capital expenditures and recurring capital replacements, partially offset by decreased property redevelopment and repositioning activities and decreased reconstruction-related capital expenditures relating to winter storms during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash outflows for development costs was driven by increased development spend during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash outflows for contributions to affiliates was driven by a larger amount of investments made in the technology-focused limited partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash inflows from proceeds from real estate asset dispositions resulted from the disposition of one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the disposition of four multifamily communities and two land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Additional increases in billings may depend on a number of factors, including demand for and availability of our products and services, competition, pricing actions, market or industry changes, macroeconomic events such as rising inflation and interest rates, economic strength, supply chain capacity and disruptions, international conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and our ability to execute. We expect proceeds from the exercise of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units and performance stock units versus stock options granted to our employees and to vary based on our share price.

When those AMT credits are later utilized, cash taxes decline but the deferred-tax asset is written down, creating little or no P&L effect at that point. Thus, the timing difference boosts earnings first and improves cash flow only in subsequent periods, making the deferred-asset movement a notable swing factor for both metrics."

The decrease in accounts receivable during 2022 was driven by lower sales and improved collections across the majority of the Company's markets during 2022. Days sales outstanding decreased from 68 days at December 26, 2021 to 61 days at December 25, 2022, primarily due to the improved collections described above.\nInventories decreased 51% in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting enterprise-wide efforts to reduce retail inventory levels while improving the quality of inventory on hand.

Inventories increased 23% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily reflecting accelerated inventory purchases attributable to the Company's Consumer Products and Wizards of the Coast businesses, to mitigate the impact of certain global supply chain challenges. However, as global supply chain constraints began to subside in 2022, the Company experienced lower than anticipated Consumer Products sales, resulting in higher inventory levels."", ""['management 2019s discussion and analysis 144 jpmorgan chase & co./2010 annual report compared with $ 57 million for 2009 .', 'decreases in cio and mort- gage banking var for 2010 were again driven by the decline in market volatility and position changes .', 'the decline in mortgage banking var at december 31 , 2010 , reflects management 2019s deci- sion to reduce risk given market volatility at the time .', 'the firm 2019s average ib and other var diversification benefit was $ 59 million or 37% ( 37 % ) of the sum for 2010 , compared with $ 82 million or 28% ( 28 % ) of the sum for 2009 .', 'the firm experienced an increase in the diversification benefit in 2010 as positions changed and correla- tions decreased .', 'in general , over the course of the year , var expo- sure can vary significantly as positions change , market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change .', 'var back-testing the firm conducts daily back-testing of var against its market risk- related revenue , which is defined as the change in value of : princi- pal transactions revenue for ib and cio ( less private equity gains/losses and revenue from longer-term cio investments ) ; trading-related net interest income for ib , cio and mortgage bank- ing ; ib brokerage commissions , underwriting fees or other revenue ; revenue from syndicated lending facilities that the firm intends to distribute ; and mortgage fees and related income for the firm 2019s mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans , msrs , and all related hedges .', 'daily firmwide market risk 2013related revenue excludes gains and losses from dva .', 'the following histogram illustrates the daily market risk 2013related gains and losses for ib , cio and mortgage banking positions for 2010 .', 'the chart shows that the firm posted market risk 2013related gains on 248 out of 261 days in this period , with 12 days exceeding $ 210 million .', 'the inset graph looks at those days on which the firm experienced losses and depicts the amount by which the 95% ( 95 % ) confidence-level var ex- ceeded the actual loss on each of those days .', 'during 2010 , losses were sustained on 13 days , none of which exceeded the var measure .', 'daily ib and other market risk-related gains and losses ( 95% ( 95 % ) confidence-level var ) year ended december 31 , 2010 average daily revenue : $ 87 million $ in millions $ in millions daily ib and other var less market risk-related losses the following table provides information about the gross sensitivity of dva to a one-basis-point increase in jpmorgan chase 2019s credit spreads .', 'this sensitivity represents the impact from a one-basis-point parallel shift in jpmorgan chase 2019s entire credit curve .', 'as credit curves do not typically move in a parallel fashion , the sensitivity multiplied by the change in spreads at a single maturity point may not be representative of the actual revenue recognized .', 'debit valuation adjustment sensitivity 1 basis point increase in december 31 , ( in millions ) jpmorgan chase 2019s credit spread .'] december 31 ( in millions ) 1 basis point increase in jpmorgan chase 2019s credit spread 2010 $ 35 2009 $ 39 ['.']"", 'In 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane memory business, which is part of our DCAI operating segment.

90,90,59f6aa2f,Cost impact margins for Stryker cybersecurity.,"While the provided data does not offer specific cost figures or detailed line items tied directly to cybersecurity spending, it is possible to discuss the qualitative cost implications on Stryker’s profitability and operating margins. The disclosure indicates that Stryker invests significantly in cybersecurity by hiring experienced personnel (including a CISO with decades of experience and a team holding over 140 certifications), implementing regular training programs, and using advanced tools (such as vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and external assessments). These efforts are viewed as essential operating expenses:

1. Short-Term Impact: The ongoing expenses related to cybersecurity—salaries for experienced security staff, costs for training programs, third-party assessments, and technology investments—are likely to increase the company’s operating expenses. In the short term, these costs could compress operating margins as they add to the SG&A or costs of doing business. 

2. Long-Term Benefits: On the other hand, these investments are designed to mitigate the risk of data breaches or cyber incidents that could have material adverse effects on profitability. By preventing costly disruptions and reputational damage, these cybersecurity measures can preserve long-term shareholder value and stabilize profit margins.

3. Strategic Trade-Off: The qualitative disclosure suggests that cybersecurity is not viewed as an optional expense but a crucial element of risk management that is essential for maintaining operational continuity. While higher operating expenses may slightly dampen margins in the near term, they are expected to safeguard the company’s overall financial health and competitive positioning in the long run.

In summary, although specific numbers cannot be derived from the provided information, Stryker’s strategy implies that the immediate cost implications include higher operating expenses that may reduce margins. However, this is offset by a risk management approach designed to avert much larger losses from potential cybersecurity incidents, thereby protecting long-term profitability.","['RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\nWe review cybersecurity risk as part of our overall enterprise risk management program.

91,91,5102022a,WEC's union/non-union mix & labor influence on flexibility and cash flows.,"Calculation:
- Total employees = 7,000
- Union employees = 4,128
- Non-union employees = 7,000 - 4,128 = 2,872
- Percentage of non-union employees = (2,872 / 7,000) × 100 ≈ 41.03%

Analysis:
The non-union portion of the workforce is approximately 2,872 employees, translating to about 41% of the total workforce. Shifts between union and non-union labor can significantly impact operational flexibility and future cash flow trends. With a higher percentage of non-union employees, the company might benefit from greater operational flexibility due to the potential for more agile labor contracts, quicker adjustments in scheduling, and potentially lower incremental labor cost adjustments. Conversely, union employees may have negotiated wage increases, standardized benefit packages, and work rules that could constrain rapid shifts in cost structures, thus influencing cash flow planning.

Future cash flow trends may be affected by the balance between the two groups. Increased reliance on non-union labor could allow more adaptability in managing costs during economic fluctuations, but it may also lead to challenges in ensuring consistent productivity and potential labor turnover. On the other hand, a strong union presence can provide workforce stability and predictability in labor costs but might also impose limitations on cost reduction initiatives when needed. Overall, the interplay between union and non-union labor dynamics is a key factor in managing both operational flexibility and financial adaptability.","['Workforce\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had the following number of employees at WEC, including those represented under union agreements:\nTotal Employees\t\tUnion Employees\nWE\t\t2,533 \t\t\t1,955 \t\nWPS\t\t1,154 \t\t\t832 \t\nWG\t\t378 \t\t\t260 \t\nPGL\t\t1,221 \t\t\t830 \t\nNSG\t\t154 \t\t\t119 \t\nMERC\t\t197 \t\t\t41 \t\nMGU\t\t141 \t\t\t91 \t\nWBS\t\t1,222 \t\t\t— \t\nTotal employees\t\t7,000 \t\t\t4,128 \t\n \n\nWe have a local union presence that spans Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan.

Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Item 1A.

Our principal source of liquidity is our cash flows provided by operating activities. Our cash flows provided by operating activities are reduced by cash used to, among other things, fulfill contractual obligations for minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases, which often extend beyond one year; the weighted average remaining lease term of our operating lease portfolio is 7.0 years. Our cash flows provided by operating activities are also reduced by cash used for unconditional legally binding commitments to purchase goods or services (i.e., purchase obligations), which are primarily related to inventory expected to be purchased within one year.\nOther significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include contractual obligations such as scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness and tax on deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, which will be paid annually over the next three years. We may also be obligated to make payments for contingent consideration due to past acquisitions, the timing and amount of which may be uncertain, and the magnitude of which can vary from year to year. Other significant factors that affect our liquidity include certain actions controlled by management such as capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends. See Note 10, Note 12 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which is provided for under the Credit Agreement) and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.\nOf our $222.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023, $196.7 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries.

On October 2, 2023, we executed new cross-currency swap agreements with six different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate (the ""2023 Cross-currency swap agreements""). Under the terms of the new swap agreements, we notionally exchanged $500 million at an interest rate of 4.63% for €474.7 million at an interest rate of 3.05%. The 2023 Cross-currency swap agreements, which expire on October 4, 2025, are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements.\nIn December 2023, we entered into a zero cost foreign exchange collar contract that aligns with the notional amount and expiration date of the 2023 Cross-currency swaps. We sold a put option with a lower strike price and bought a call option with a higher strike price to manage the foreign exchange risk related to the final settlement of the $500 million notional cross currency swaps. Upon the execution of the zero cost foreign exchange collar contract, we have de-designated the existing $500 million notional cross-currency swaps and re-designated the combined $500 million notional cross currency swaps and zero cost collar into a new hedging instrument. At re-designation, the existing $500 million notional cross-currency swaps were off-market due to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The off-market value due to interest rates will be amortized ratably into earnings through October 2025 and the off-market value due to foreign exchange rates will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying net investment is sold. The combined cross-currency swaps and zero cost collar has been designated as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes.\nUnder the terms of our outstanding Euro cross-currency swap agreements, we notionally exchanged in the aggregate $750 million for €693.9 million. The swap agreements begin to expire in March 2024. We and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement. As a result, we may be required to pay (or be entitled to receive) an amount equal to the difference, on the expiration or earlier termination dates, between\nthe U.S. dollar equivalent of the €693.9 million notional amount and the $750 million notional amount. If, at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements, the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate has increased or decreased by 10% from the rate in effect at the inception of these agreements, we would either receive an aggregate payment of approximately $34.4 million from the counterparties or be required to make an aggregate payment of approximately $75 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement. As of December 31, 2023, we had $16.5 million in current assets and $31.3 million in non-current liabilities related to the fair value of our cross-currency swap agreements. The swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements. However, we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with different counterparties, all of which are large, well-established financial institutions.', 'Liquidity and capital resources are primarily impacted by our operating activities, proceeds from issuance of our investment grade debt, as well as cash used on stock repurchases, real estate purchases and other capital expenditures, investments in various companies and business acquisitions.\nIn recent years, we have received significant capital resources from our billings to customers, issuance of investment grade debt and, to some extent, from the exercise of stock options by our employees. Additional increases in billings may depend on a number of factors, including demand for and availability of our products and services, competition, pricing actions, market or industry changes, macroeconomic events such as rising inflation and interest rates, economic strength, supply chain capacity and disruptions, international conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and our ability to execute. We expect proceeds from the exercise of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units and performance stock units versus stock options granted to our employees and to vary based on our share price. We expect our cash tax payments to increase as a result of a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, other tax law changes and our expected growth.', 'Liquidity and Cash Flows: Our primary source of working capital is cash operating results. The primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit commitments under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Revolving Loan Facility.”).

These factors are further discussed in the “Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe also generate additional working capital and liquidity from the sale of assets and the issuance of shares through option exercises and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In addition, we believe we have access to additional liquidity from the sale of equity or debt securities, if needed.', 'We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts.\nWe had negative working capital of $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.  \nWe believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, including commercial paper, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.', 'Liquidity and capital resources represent the overall strength of a company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at a competitive rate and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. We are monitoring our liquidity closely and feel confident in our ability to meet all long-term obligations to customers, policyholders and debt holders. Our sources of strength include our laddered long-term debt maturities with the next maturity occurring in 2025, access to revolving credit facility and contingent funding arrangements, a strong risk-based capital position and our available cash and liquid assets. Our legal entity structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. Following is a simplified organizational structure.\nOur liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be met by funds from consolidated operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from credit facilities.

Because most field and plant positions are covered by multi-year collective-bargaining agreements, day-to-day staffing levels and work rules are relatively inflexible; however, those contracts also lock in wage-escalation schedules that WEC can generally pass through regulated rates, so cash-flow pressure is limited unless a contract expires without renewal and triggers overtime, replacement-power purchases or a strike."
92,92,8361d4e8,REIT Alexandria's risk-reward metrics.,"The reference text does not offer direct numerical data, but we can answer the question by identifying the typical financial metrics that investors use to evaluate whether a REIT like Alexandria is balancing risk and reward effectively when competing for high‐quality properties. In the context of a competitive market where investment opportunities are scarce and bidding pressures are intense, analysts would look to several key metrics:

1. Funds from Operations (FFO) Yield – This metric measures operating performance relative to the stock price and indicates how well the REIT is generating cash from its core property operations. A strong and stable or growing FFO yield suggests that Alexandria is extracting sufficient returns from its property investments to cover risks.

2. Occupancy Rates and Rental Growth – High occupancy rates combined with steady or increasing rental income are indicative of property desirability and effective management in a competitive market. Stable or rising occupancy rates help confirm that Alexandria is attracting high-caliber tenants.

3. Debt-to-Capital or Leverage Ratios – These ratios illustrate how much debt is used to finance property acquisitions relative to equity. A balanced capital structure that limits over-leverage while still allowing for growth is a sign that the company is cautiously managing risk.

4. Net Operating Income (NOI) and Operating Margins – Strong NOI performance reflects the company’s ability to generate income from its properties after all operating expenses. A high or improving NOI margin indicates that the company is capturing sufficient reward relative to the risks taken.

5. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) – This ratio shows the efficiency of how capital is being deployed into property acquisitions or development projects. A competitive ROIC implies that the company is generating good returns on the capital committed to new opportunities.

While the provided reference outlines the competitive pressures Alexandria faces when acquiring or developing properties, investors would typically refer to the company’s detailed financial statements and investor presentations to verify these performance metrics. Superior performance in these metrics — when benchmarked against industry averages — would suggest that Alexandria is managing to balance risk and reward effectively despite intense competition in the market.","['In general, other laboratory and technology properties are located in close proximity to our properties.

Our management approach is driven by people, culture, policies, targets and performance monitoring to improve the value from our investments of time, talent and financial resources. This approach directly supports Host’s business strategy and goals.\n•Environmental Stewardship: We are investing in solutions that conserve and restore natural capital to assist us in mitigating climate change and biodiversity impacts with the goal of achieving best-in-class returns.\n•Social Responsibility: We are committed to advancing health, well-being and opportunity for all of our stakeholders, including investors, employees, partners and communities.\n•Governance: Our responsible investment strategies are guided by executive and board-level oversight, our EPIC values of Excellence, Partnership, Integrity and Community, our ethical standards, and a disciplined approach to risk management and sustainable value creation.\nThe Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) (now maintained by the International Sustainability Standards Board under the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) outlines the disclosure topics and accounting metrics for the real estate industry.

The pillars of our strategy to achieve this objective and elevate our growth profile include:\n•Geographically diverse portfolio of hotels in the U.S. - Own a diversified portfolio of hotels in the U.S. in major urban and resort destinations. Target markets with diverse demand generators, high barriers to entry, favorable supply and demand dynamics and attractive long-term projected RevPAR growth;•Strong scale and integrated platform - Utilize our scale to create value through enterprise analytics, asset management and capital investment initiatives, while aiding external growth by leveraging scale as a competitive advantage to acquire assets befitting our strategy. Allocate and recycle capital to seek returns that exceed our cost of capital and actively return capital to stockholders;\n•Investment grade balance sheet - Maintain a strong and flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout all phases of the lodging cycle; and\n•Employer of choice and responsible corporate citizen - Align our organizational structure with our business objectives to be an employer of choice and a responsible corporate citizen.\nGeographically Diverse Portfolio\nWe seek to have a geographically diversified portfolio in major markets and premier resort destinations in the U.S. We primarily focus on acquisitions and, occasionally, new development opportunities to enhance our portfolio. While we have historically targeted acquisitions in the top 25 U.S. markets, we also consider hotels in other markets, which we believe have high growth potential and diverse demand generators. We focus generally on the following types of assets:\n•Resorts in destination locations with limited supply growth. These assets feature superior amenities and unique experiential offerings;\n•Convention destination hotels that are group oriented in urban and resort markets. These assets feature extensive and high-quality meeting facilities and often are connected to prominent convention centers; and\n•High-end urban hotels that are positioned in prime locations and possess multiple demand drivers for both business and leisure travelers.\nAs one of the largest owners of Marriott and Hyatt hotels, our hotels primarily are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Within these brands, we have focused predominantly on the upper-upscale and luxury chain scales, as we believe these have a broad appeal for both individual and group leisure and business customers. In addition, we own several unbranded or soft-branded hotels that appeal to distinctive customer profiles in certain submarkets.Strong Scale and Integrated Platform\nEnterprise Analytics Platform. Due to the scale of our asset management and business intelligence platform, we believe we are in a unique position to implement value-added real estate decisions and to assist our managers in improving operating performance and profitability. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading brands and operators in the industry allow our enterprise analytics team to benchmark similar hotels and identify revenue-enhancement opportunities and cost efficiencies that can maximize the operating performance, long-term profitability and value of our real estate. We perform independent underwriting of return on investment (“ROI”) projects and potential acquisitions, as well as revenue management analysis of ancillary revenue opportunities. Our goal is to continue to differentiate our hotels within their competitive markets, drive operating performance and enhance the overall value of our real estate through the following:\n•Enhance operating performance and profitability by using our business intelligence system to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls.\n•Drive revenue growth by conducting detailed strategic reviews with our managers on markets and business mix to assist them in developing the appropriate group/transient mix, online presence to address a broad customer base, and market share targets for each hotel.\n•Work with leading brands, such as Marriott and Hyatt, to take advantage of their worldwide presence and lodging infrastructure. We also have a selection of hotels managed by independent operators where we believe these operators have more flexibility to drive revenues and control costs to maximize profits.•Improve asset value through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements to increase contract flexibility.\nDisciplined Capital Allocation. Guided by a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are equipped to make investment decisions that seek to deliver the greatest value and returns to stockholders. Our goal is to allocate capital to enhance and improve our portfolio, while balancing the importance of prudently returning capital to stockholders.\nFor 2024, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation and intend to take advantage of our strong balance sheet and overall scale. We are constantly evaluating potential acquisitions of iconic upper-upscale and luxury properties that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages. Similarly, we intend to continue our capital recycling program with strategic and opportunistic dispositions. This may include the sale of assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or hotels with significant capital expenditure requirements that we do not believe would generate an adequate return.\nWe may acquire additional properties or dispose of properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders. We anticipate that any acquisitions may be funded by, or through a combination of, proceeds from the sales of hotels, equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., incurrence of debt, available cash or advances under our credit facility. We note, however, that the nature and supply of these assets make acquisitions inherently difficult to predict. For these reasons, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in purchasing any one or more hotels that we are reviewing currently, or may in the future review, bid on or negotiate to buy.\nWe also seek to create and mine value from our existing portfolio through value enhancement initiatives and ROI projects. We believe these investments provide a significant opportunity to achieve returns well in excess of our cost of capital. We work closely with our managers to attempt to schedule these projects to minimize operational disruption and environmental impact. Value enhancement initiatives seek to maximize the value of real estate within our existing portfolio through its highest and best use. These projects may include hotel expansion, timeshare, office space or condominium units on excess land, redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space, and the acquisition of development entitlements. ROI projects are designed to improve the positioning of our hotels within their markets and competitive set. These projects include extensive renovations, including guest rooms, lobbies, food and beverage outlets; expansions and/or extensive renovation of ballroom and meeting rooms; major mechanical system upgrades; and green building initiatives and certifications. Also included are projects focused on increasing space profitability or lowering net operating costs, such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space, adding guestrooms, and implementing energy and water conservation measures such as LED lighting, high-efficiency mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment and fixtures, solar power, energy management systems, guestroom water efficient fixtures, and building automation systems.\nRenewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels. Typically, renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven to ten years, but the timing may vary based on the type of property, function of area being renovated, hotel occupancy and other factors. These renovations generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, case goods, bathroom and architectural and engineering systems. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, textiles and wall finishes, which may require more frequent updates to maintain brand quality standards. Case goods include dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and meeting room tables and chairs, which generally are not replaced as frequently. Bathroom renovations include the refurbishment or replacement of tile, vanity, lighting and plumbing fixtures. Architectural and engineering systems include the physical plant of the hotel, including the roof, elevators/escalators, façade, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and fire systems.\nThroughout the lodging cycle, to the extent that we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities that meet our return requirements, we will focus on returning capital to stockholders through dividends or common stock repurchases. Significant factors we review to determine the level and timing of the returns to stockholders include our current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets, current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales.', 'Investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment companies, pension funds, private equity investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers, and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater flexibility (e.g., non-REIT competitors), greater resources, and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition and resulting capitalization rate compression, as well as the impacts of inflation and higher interest rates, make it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives.

• Market position: largest, long-tenured life-science landlord in “AAA” clusters; low voluntary employee turnover of 4.1 % (2019-23 average) supports operating stability.  

Risk metrics (2023)  
• Profit squeeze: expenses jumped 26 %, driving the net-income margin down to 9.7 % (25.9 % in 2022) and cutting net income attributable to common holders to 92 m (-82 % YoY).  
• Asset write-downs: real-estate impairments surged to 461 m (16 % of revenue).  
• Leverage pressure: interest coverage fell to about 4.8× (355 m pre-interest earnings ÷ 74 m interest) versus 8.1× in 2022.  

Overall, Alexandria offers solid revenue growth and a dominant niche position, but rising impairments and shrinking coverage ratios signal elevated near-term risk relative to recent years."
93,93,936177dc,DIS EPS sensitivity to share count change (1827 vs DIS 1831) with constant NI.,"To determine the percentage change in diluted EPS, assume that net income remains constant over the period. Diluted EPS is calculated as Net Income divided by the weighted average diluted share count. For 2022, EPS = NI/1,827 and for 2024, EPS = NI/1,831. When net income is unchanged, the ratio of EPS from 2024 to EPS from 2022 is:

  EPS2024/EPS2022 = (NI/1,831)/(NI/1,827) = 1,827/1,831

The percentage change in EPS is then given by:

  Percentage Change = [(EPS2024 – EPS2022) / EPS2022] × 100
    = [(1,827/1,831 – 1) × 100]
    = [(-4/1,831) × 100]
    ≈ -0.22%

Thus, if Disney’s net income stayed constant, the increase in diluted share count from 1,827 in 2022 to 1,831 in 2024 would translate into approximately a 0.22% decrease in diluted EPS.","['The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts.

94,94,55c981be,Financial risk mitigation via 3M's (MMM) cybersecurity framework.,"The provided information explains that 3M integrates cybersecurity policies into its overall risk management framework by embedding processes for the continuous assessment, identification, and management of material cybersecurity threats. This integrated approach mitigates financial risks in several ways:

1. **Board and Audit Committee Oversight**: The Board’s audit committee, along with regular reports from the Chief Information and Digital Officer (CIDO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), ensures that cybersecurity risks are continually monitored and addressed. This top-level oversight helps in making timely, strategic decisions aimed at preventing or mitigating incidents, thereby reducing potential financial liabilities.

2. **Proactive Risk Identification and Response**: By incorporating thorough risk assessments, security assessments of third-party providers, and regular updates from senior cybersecurity executives, the system is designed to detect vulnerabilities early. This enables the company to implement remediation measures quickly, lowering the impact and associated costs of any data breaches or security incidents.

3. **Coordination with External Experts**: The involvement of third-party consultants, legal advisors, and audit firms in evaluating cybersecurity risk management strategies further enhances the robustness of the approach. These expert evaluations can highlight additional risks and ensure best practices are followed, contributing to cost-effective incident prevention and management.

4. **Integrated Incident Response Planning**: The CISO’s role in overseeing cybersecurity incident response plans ensures that in case of a breach, structured procedures are executed, thereby limiting financial fallout from regulatory fines, legal liabilities, and remediation costs.

Overall, the integration of cybersecurity policies into the broader risk management framework ensures that any potential financial impact from cybersecurity incidents is minimized through vigilant oversight, proactive risk management, and coordinated incident response—all of which contribute to the reduction of unexpected financial losses and improved investor confidence.","['Risk Management and Strategy\nThe Company has processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. These processes are integrated into the Company’s overall risk management systems, as overseen by the Company’s board of directors, primarily through its audit committee. These processes also include overseeing and identifying risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers. The Company conducts security assessments of certain third-party providers before engagement and has established monitoring procedures in its effort to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third parties. The Company from time to time engages third-party consultants, legal advisors, and audit firms in evaluating and testing the Company’s risk management systems and assessing and remediating certain potential cybersecurity incidents as appropriate.\nGovernance\nBoard of Directors\nThe audit committee of the Company’s board of directors oversees, among other things, the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls, including internal controls designed to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The audit committee is informed of material risks from cybersecurity threats pursuant to the escalation criteria as set forth in the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Further, at least once per quarter, the Company’s Chief Information and Digital Officer (“CIDO”), and/or the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) reports on cybersecurity matters, including material risks and threats, to the Company’s audit committee, and the audit committee provides updates to the Company’s board of directors at regular board meetings.

provided we remain in compliance with all covenants. We have no debt reaching final maturity until January 2026, provided all extension options are exercised.\nPublic Offerings\nOn August 2, 2023, in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement, we issued (1) $450,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.45% Senior Notes which mature on August 15, 2030 and (2) $350,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes which mature on August 15, 2033. A portion of the proceeds from these public offerings were used to pay down $150.0 million of then-outstanding indebtedness on our Revolving Facility, and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, repayment of other indebtedness including secured debt, working capital, acquisitions, and renovations of single-family properties.\nAcquisition of Single-family Residential Properties\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we completed the purchase of a portfolio of 1,870 single-family residential homes with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $646.6 million.\nSOFR Transition\nOn April 18, 2023, we amended the 2020 Term Loan and Revolving Facilities (the “Credit Facility”) to convert the applicable interest rate from a London Interbank Offered Rate-based (“LIBOR”) index to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate-based (“SOFR”) index rate determined by reference to a published forward-looking SOFR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing (“Term SOFR”) and converted the variable rate on our interest rate swap agreements from a LIBOR-based index to a Term SOFR-based index.\nEffective July 3, 2023, one of our mortgage loans, IH 2018-4, was amended to transition to a Term SOFR-based index from a LIBOR-based index. The related interest rate cap agreement was amended effective July 15, 2023 to transition to a Term SOFR-based index from a LIBOR-based index. These modifications did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThese transactions completed the conversion of all LIBOR-based agreements to Term SOFR.\nProperty Management\nIn January 2024, we entered into an agreement with a third-party portfolio owner of single-family residential homes to provide property and asset management services for approximately 14,000 homes.

Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”', 'In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $649 billion and $694 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The decrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., partially offset by an increase in unencumbered AFS securities.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts of $798.0 billion and $735.5 billion, respectively, and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $649 billion and $694 billion, respectively.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $340 billion and $323 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2022 primarily due to a higher amount of wholesale loans pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.', 'As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $70.3 million under our Revolving facility that principally support our self-insurance programs.', 'We believe our liquid assets, cash generated from operations, and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2023, we were authorized to borrow up to $1.5 billion through a revolving line of credit and committed term loans, which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks. The revolving line of credit authorizes us to borrow up to $1.0 billion under a five-year term expiring September 2027, and allows us to request an increase in the revolving line of credit total commitment by up to $300 million and to request two one-year extensions of the maturity date. The committed term loans authorized us to borrow up to an additional $500 million during the nine-month period beginning September 27, 2022, due September 2025, which we exercised in June 2023. The applicable interest rates under this agreement are based on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or a Base Rate, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin and other fees.

• Income Before Taxes (2023): $7,159 million 
• Net Sales (2023): $36,662 million 

Operating Margin Ratio = 7,159 / 36,662 ≈ 0.195 or about 19.5%

99,99,00b0e3cd,EPS growth for ADP from 2022 to 2024 and implications for investors.,"Basic earnings per share (EPS) increased from $7.04 in fiscal 2022 to $9.14 in fiscal 2024. To calculate the percentage growth: 

Percentage Growth = [(9.14 - 7.04) / 7.04] × 100 ≈ (2.10 / 7.04) × 100 ≈ 29.9%

This approximately 30% growth in EPS over the period is a positive indicator of improved profitability. Such an increase generally bolsters investor confidence, as it reflects better earnings performance and may lead to a higher valuation of the company's shares. Investors might interpret this EPS growth as a sign of efficient capital allocation and a robust operating model, potentially reinforcing expectations of future profitability and reinforcing upward trends in share value. However, investment decisions should also consider other factors such as industry dynamics, market risks, and broader macroeconomic conditions.","['Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nStatements of Consolidated Earnings\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n\nYears ended June 30,\t\t2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\nREVENUES:\t\t \t\t \t\t\nRevenues, other than interest on funds held\n     for clients and PEO revenues\t\t$\t11,953.6 \t\t\t$\t11,222.0 \t\t\t$\t10,505.0 \t\nInterest on funds held for clients\t\t1,024.7 \t\t\t813.4 \t\t\t451.8 \t\nPEO revenues (A)\t\t6,224.3 \t\t\t5,976.8 \t\t\t5,541.5 \t\nTOTAL REVENUES\t\t19,202.6 \t\t\t18,012.2 \t\t\t16,498.3 \t\nEXPENSES:\t\t \t\t \t\t\nCosts of revenues:\t\t \t\t \t\t\nOperating expenses\t\t9,050.1 \t\t\t8,657.4 \t\t\t8,252.6 \t\nResearch and development\t\t955.7 \t\t\t844.8 \t\t\t798.6 \t\nDepreciation and amortization\t\t470.9 \t\t\t451.2 \t\t\t410.7 \t\nTOTAL COSTS OF REVENUES\t\t10,476.7 \t\t\t9,953.4 \t\t\t9,461.9 \t\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\t\t3,778.9 \t\t\t3,551.4 \t\t\t3,233.2 \t\nInterest expense\t\t361.4 \t\t\t253.3 \t\t\t81.9 \t\nTOTAL EXPENSES\t\t14,617.0 \t\t\t13,758.1 \t\t\t12,777.0 \t\nOther (income)/expense, net\t\t(286.7)\t\t\t(183.5)\t\t\t(82.8)\t\nEARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\t\t4,872.3 \t\t\t4,437.6 \t\t\t3,804.1 \t\nProvision for income taxes\t\t1,120.3 \t\t\t1,025.6 \t\t\t855.2 \t\nNET EARNINGS\t\t$\t3,752.0 \t\t\t$\t3,412.0 \t\t\t$\t2,948.9 \t\nBASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE\t\t$\t9.14 \t\t\t$\t8.25 \t\t\t$\t7.04 \t\nDILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\t\t$\t9.10 \t\t\t$\t8.21 \t\t\t$\t7.00 \t\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding\t\t410.6 \t\t\t413.7 \t\t\t418.8 \t\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\t\t412.2 \t\t\t415.7 \t\t\t421.1 \t\n \n(A) For the years ended June 30, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”), June 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”), and June 30, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”), Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) revenues are net of direct pass-through costs, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes, of $69,874.1 million, $66,731.7 million, and $62,619.2 million, respectively.']",,Compositional,FinDER,Compositional,"['Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nStatements of Consolidated Earnings\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n\nYears ended June 30,\t\t2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\nREVENUES:\t\t \t\t \t\t\nRevenues, other than interest on funds held\n     for clients and PEO revenues\t\t$\t11,953.6 \t\t\t$\t11,222.0 \t\t\t$\t10,505.0 \t\nInterest on funds held for clients\t\t1,024.7 \t\t\t813.4 \t\t\t451.8 \t\nPEO revenues (A)\t\t6,224.3 \t\t\t5,976.8 \t\t\t5,541.5 \t\nTOTAL REVENUES\t\t19,202.6 \t\t\t18,012.2 \t\t\t16,498.3 \t\nEXPENSES:\t\t \t\t \t\t\nCosts of revenues:\t\t \t\t \t\t\nOperating expenses\t\t9,050.1 \t\t\t8,657.4 \t\t\t8,252.6 \t\nResearch and development\t\t955.7 \t\t\t844.8 \t\t\t798.6 \t\nDepreciation and amortization\t\t470.9 \t\t\t451.2 \t\t\t410.7 \t\nTOTAL COSTS OF REVENUES\t\t10,476.7 \t\t\t9,953.4 \t\t\t9,461.9 \t\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\t\t3,778.9 \t\t\t3,551.4 \t\t\t3,233.2 \t\nInterest expense\t\t361.4 \t\t\t253.3 \t\t\t81.9 \t\nTOTAL EXPENSES\t\t14,617.0 \t\t\t13,758.1 \t\t\t12,777.0 \t\nOther (income)/expense, net\t\t(286.7)\t\t\t(183.5)\t\t\t(82.8)\t\nEARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\t\t4,872.3 \t\t\t4,437.6 \t\t\t3,804.1 \t\nProvision for income taxes\t\t1,120.3 \t\t\t1,025.6 \t\t\t855.2 \t\nNET EARNINGS\t\t$\t3,752.0 \t\t\t$\t3,412.0 \t\t\t$\t2,948.9 \t\nBASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE\t\t$\t9.14 \t\t\t$\t8.25 \t\t\t$\t7.04 \t\nDILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\t\t$\t9.10 \t\t\t$\t8.21 \t\t\t$\t7.00 \t\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding\t\t410.6 \t\t\t413.7 \t\t\t418.8 \t\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\t\t412.2 \t\t\t415.7 \t\t\t421.1 \t\n \n(A) For the years ended June 30, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”), June 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”), and June 30, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”), Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) revenues are net of direct pass-through costs, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes, of $69,874.1 million, $66,731.7 million, and $62,619.2 million, respectively.']",00b0e3cd,True,"['Inflation continues to trend lower while remaining at levels above the Federal Reserve’s long run target. The Federal Reserve has shifted policy to a more balanced interest rate view and continues to further evaluate the impact of their monetary tightening and the overall health of the economy. The economy has continued to expand with fourth quarter of 2023 growth trending towards 2.0%. Equity markets have remained buoyant anticipating easier policy from the Federal Reserve in 2024. Further banking regulation has been delayed as recent regulatory proposals have been in their comment periods for an extended amount of time, with clarity on proposed amendments to the regulatory capital rule and long-term debt requirements for banks anticipated.\nThe consensus economic outlook assumes a soft landing through the first half of 2024 with modest growth in the second half of 2024. Inflation is expected to continue to fall, approaching target levels of 2% by the third quarter of 2024, as the Federal Reserve actions will likely result in lower GDP growth and higher unemployment.\nOur 2023 results reflect the execution of our growth strategy and leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, delivered through sustained deposit growth, bolstered capabilities across our payments and other fee revenue areas, and expansion of our CET1. We have continued our disciplined management of credit consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low, through-the-cycle risk appetite. With our disciplined and proactive approach, we believe Huntington is well positioned to manage through the uncertain economic outlook on the horizon. We remain focused on delivering profitable growth and driving value for our shareholders.', 'The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by lower net maturities of investments in 2023 as compared to 2022 and higher payments for business combinations in 2023.', 'Diluted earnings per share was $2.52 in 2023 and 2022. In 2023, diluted earnings per share was driven primarily by the impact of higher operating income, an increase in interest expense, the unfavorable effects of a decrease in other income, and an increase in income from unconsolidated operations. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by $0.18 and $0.15 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. A gain on our sale of a business increased earnings per share by $0.14 in 2022. Excluding the effects of special charges, transaction and integration expenses, and the gain realized from the sale of a business, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.70 in 2023 and $2.53 in 2022, or an increase of 6.7%.', 'Management forecasts approximately $7.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024.  For the four year period, 2025 through 2028, management forecasts capital expenditures of $35 billion. The expenditures are generally for transmission, generation, distribution, regulated renewables and required environmental investment to comply with the Federal EPA rules.  Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain issues, weather, legal reviews, inflation and the ability to access capital.

101,101,984daf24,Elevance Health’s gross margin in 2023 vs ELV 2022.,"For 2023, gross profit is calculated as Total operating revenue minus Cost of products sold. Using the data:

• 2023 Gross Profit = $170,209 million - $17,293 million = $152,916 million
• 2023 Gross Profit Margin = ($152,916 / $170,209) × 100 ≈ 89.9%

For 2022, the calculations are:

• 2022 Gross Profit = $155,660 million - $13,035 million = $142,625 million
• 2022 Gross Profit Margin = ($142,625 / $155,660) × 100 ≈ 91.6%

Thus, the gross profit margin declined from approximately 91.6% in 2022 to about 89.9% in 2023.","['Elevance Health, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n\n \tYears Ended December 31\n(In millions, except per share data)\t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nRevenues\t\t\t\t\t\nPremiums\t$\t142,854 \t\t\t$\t133,229 \t\t\t$\t117,373 \t\nProduct revenue\t19,452 \t\t\t14,978 \t\t\t12,657 \t\nService fees\t7,903 \t\t\t7,453 \t\t\t6,913 \t\nTotal operating revenue\t170,209 \t\t\t155,660 \t\t\t136,943 \t\nNet investment income\t1,825 \t\t\t1,485 \t\t\t1,378 \t\nNet (losses) gains on financial instruments\t(694)\t\t\t(550)\t\t\t318 \t\nTotal revenues\t171,340 \t\t\t156,595 \t\t\t138,639 \t\nExpenses\t\t\t\t\t\nBenefit expense\t124,330 \t\t\t116,642 \t\t\t102,571 \t\nCost of products sold\t17,293 \t\t\t13,035 \t\t\t10,895 \t\nOperating expense\t20,087 \t\t\t17,700 \t\t\t15,918 \t\nInterest expense\t1,030 \t\t\t851 \t\t\t798 \t\nAmortization of other intangible assets\t885 \t\t\t767 \t\t\t441 \t\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t21 \t\nTotal expenses\t163,625 \t\t\t148,995 \t\t\t130,644 \t\nIncome before income tax expense\t7,715 \t\t\t7,600 \t\t\t7,995 \t\nIncome tax expense\t1,724 \t\t\t1,712 \t\t\t1,846 \t\nNet income\t5,991 \t\t\t5,888 \t\t\t6,149 \t\nNet (gain) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(4)\t\t\t6 \t\t\t9 \t\nShareholders’ net income\t$\t5,987 \t\t\t$\t5,894 \t\t\t$\t6,158 \t\nShareholders’ earnings per share\nBasic\t$\t25.38 \t\t\t$\t24.56 \t\t\t$\t25.26 \t\nDiluted\t$\t25.22 \t\t\t$\t24.28 \t\t\t$\t24.95 \t\nDividends per share\t$\t5.92 \t\t\t$\t5.12 \t\t\t$\t4.52']",,Compositional,FinDER,Compositional,"['Elevance Health, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n\n \tYears Ended December 31\n(In millions, except per share data)\t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nRevenues\t\t\t\t\t\nPremiums\t$\t142,854 \t\t\t$\t133,229 \t\t\t$\t117,373 \t\nProduct revenue\t19,452 \t\t\t14,978 \t\t\t12,657 \t\nService fees\t7,903 \t\t\t7,453 \t\t\t6,913 \t\nTotal operating revenue\t170,209 \t\t\t155,660 \t\t\t136,943 \t\nNet investment income\t1,825 \t\t\t1,485 \t\t\t1,378 \t\nNet (losses) gains on financial instruments\t(694)\t\t\t(550)\t\t\t318 \t\nTotal revenues\t171,340 \t\t\t156,595 \t\t\t138,639 \t\nExpenses\t\t\t\t\t\nBenefit expense\t124,330 \t\t\t116,642 \t\t\t102,571 \t\nCost of products sold\t17,293 \t\t\t13,035 \t\t\t10,895 \t\nOperating expense\t20,087 \t\t\t17,700 \t\t\t15,918 \t\nInterest expense\t1,030 \t\t\t851 \t\t\t798 \t\nAmortization of other intangible assets\t885 \t\t\t767 \t\t\t441 \t\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t21 \t\nTotal expenses\t163,625 \t\t\t148,995 \t\t\t130,644 \t\nIncome before income tax expense\t7,715 \t\t\t7,600 \t\t\t7,995 \t\nIncome tax expense\t1,724 \t\t\t1,712 \t\t\t1,846 \t\nNet income\t5,991 \t\t\t5,888 \t\t\t6,149 \t\nNet (gain) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(4)\t\t\t6 \t\t\t9 \t\nShareholders’ net income\t$\t5,987 \t\t\t$\t5,894 \t\t\t$\t6,158 \t\nShareholders’ earnings per share\nBasic\t$\t25.38 \t\t\t$\t24.56 \t\t\t$\t25.26 \t\nDiluted\t$\t25.22 \t\t\t$\t24.28 \t\t\t$\t24.95 \t\nDividends per share\t$\t5.92 \t\t\t$\t5.12 \t\t\t$\t4.52']",984daf24,True,"['Commentary - 2023 compared to 2022\n\n•Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.8 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the timing of payments and receipts, partially offset by lower inventory purchases.\n•Net cash used in investing activities increased by $15.8 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the acquisitions of Oak Street Health in May 2023 and Signify Health in March 2023.

Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. Overall, volume/mix was favorable driven by improved product mix. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate, gum and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery and candy. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies across the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone, Ukrainian hryvnya and Swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Polish zloty, British pound sterling and Swiss franc.

Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. The August 1, 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar added incremental net revenues of $529 million through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2023. Overall, volume/mix was flat as slight volume gains were offset by unfavorable mix. Flat volume/mix was driven by gains in candy and chocolate offset by a decline in biscuits & baked snacks. While the impact of divestitures reflected a year-over-year increase in net revenues of $12 million (net of the loss of revenue for the fourth quarter) from our 2023 divested developed market gum business, it had a negative impact on the net revenue growth rate as the divested business did not grow as fast as the remaining segment. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.', 'Segment operating income increased $497 million (33.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping the prior year incremental costs incurred due to the war in Ukraine, lower acquisition integration costs and favorable volume/mix.

Gross profit increased due to higher pricing and sales volumes, which supported a 30 basis point increase in the gross profit margin. The impact from foreign currency movements decreased the gross profit margin by approximately 60 basis points, primarily from the impact of lower hedge gains in the current year compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, the increase in the gross profit margin was supported by recurring revenue net price gains, which mitigated the inflationary cost impacts that contributed to higher product and labor costs. Sales mix, including effects from high CAG Diagnostic consumable growth; software services gross margin expansion; and productivity gains in our reference laboratories also contributed to the increase in our gross profit margin.', 'Segment operating income increased $323 million (18.3%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the impact of our Clif Bar acquisition, higher operating results from the divested developed market gum business, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges.

approximately 75% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within one year. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.\nIndemnified Securities Financing\nOn behalf of our clients, we lend their securities, as agent, to brokers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. We require the borrowers to maintain collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. Collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.\nThe cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against the loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair values of indemnified securities financing and related collateral, as well as collateral invested in indemnified repurchase agreements, as of the dates indicated:\n(In millions)\tDecember 31, 2023\t\tDecember 31, 2022\nFair value of indemnified securities financing\t$\t279,916 \t\t\t$\t348,924 \t\nFair value of cash and securities held by us, as agent, as collateral for indemnified securities financing\t293,855 \t\t\t366,895 \t\nFair value of collateral for indemnified securities financing invested in indemnified repurchase agreements\t59,028 \t\t\t54,114 \t\nFair value of cash and securities held by us or our agents as collateral for investments in indemnified repurchase agreements\t63,105 \t\t\t57,903 \t\n \nIn certain cases, we participate in securities finance transactions as a principal. As a principal, we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. Our right to receive and obligation to return collateral in connection with our securities lending transactions are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had approximately $23.13 billion and $16.49 billion, respectively, of collateral provided and approximately $11.93 billion and $6.38 billion, respectively, of collateral received from clients in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions.\nStable Value Protection\nStable value funds wrapped by us are high quality diversified portfolios of short intermediate duration fixed-income investments. Stable value contracts are derivative contracts that also qualify as guarantees. The notional amount under non-hedging derivatives, provided in Note 10, generally represents our maximum exposure under these derivatives contracts. However, exposure to various stable value contracts is contractually limited to substantially lower amounts than the notional values, which represent the total assets of the stable value funds.\nStandby Letters of Credit\nStandby letters of credit provide credit enhancement to our municipal clients to support the issuance of capital markets financing.\nFICC Guarantee\nAs a sponsoring member in the FICC member program, we provide a guarantee to FICC in the event a customer fails to perform its obligations under a transaction. In order to minimize the risk associated with this guarantee, sponsored members acting as buyers generally grant a security interest in the subject securities received under and held on their behalf by State Street.\nAdditionally, as a member of certain industry clearing and settlement exchanges, we may be required to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization and provide liquidity support in the event of the default of another member to the extent that the defaulting member’s clearing fund obligation and the prescribed loss allocation is depleted. It is difficult to estimate our maximum possible exposure under the membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. At both December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not record any liabilities under these arrangements.\nFor additional information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, please refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.', 'STATE STREET CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nYears Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nOperating Activities:\t\t\t\t\t\nNet income\t$\t1,944 \t\t\t$\t2,774 \t\t\t$\t2,693 \t\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\t\t\t\t\t\nDeferred income tax (benefit)\t(184)\t\t\t(62)\t\t\t(162)\t\nAmortization of other intangible assets\t239 \t\t\t238 \t\t\t245 \t\nOther non-cash adjustments for depreciation, amortization and accretion, net\t643 \t\t\t918 \t\t\t1,312 \t\nLosses (gains) related to investment securities, net\t294 \t\t\t2 \t\t\t(57)\t\nProvision for credit losses\t46 \t\t\t20 \t\t\t(33)\t\nChange in trading account assets, net\t(123)\t\t\t108 \t\t\t57 \t\nChange in accrued interest and fees receivable, net\t(359)\t\t\t(156)\t\t\t(173)\t\nChange in collateral deposits, net\t(2,246)\t\t\t7,821 \t\t\t(7,662)\t\nChange in unrealized losses (gains) on foreign exchange derivatives, net\t2,146 \t\t\t(1,125)\t\t\t(3,448)\t\nChange in other assets, net\t(1,839)\t\t\t421 \t\t\t691 \t\nChange in accrued expenses and other liabilities, net\t(128)\t\t\t557 \t\t\t(574)\t\nOther, net\t257 \t\t\t438 \t\t\t401 \t\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\t690 \t\t\t11,954 \t\t\t(6,710)\t\nInvesting Activities:\t\t\t\t\t\nNet decrease (increase) in interest-bearing deposits with banks\t13,928 \t\t\t4,765 \t\t\t10,602 \t\nNet (increase) decrease in securities purchased under resale agreements\t(1,477)\t\t\t(2,203)\t\t\t94 \t\nProceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities\t4,917 \t\t\t4,590 \t\t\t12,822 \t\nProceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities\t15,703 \t\t\t17,254 \t\t\t23,484 \t\nPurchases of available-for-sale securities\t(23,089)\t\t\t(18,029)\t\t\t(53,750)\t\nProceeds from maturities of held-to-maturity securities under the MMLF program\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t3,299 \t\nProceeds from maturities of held-to-maturity securities\t9,474 \t\t\t9,817 \t\t\t15,586 \t\nPurchases of held-to-maturity securities\t(1,582)\t\t\t(8,564)\t\t\t(8,583)\t\nSale of loans\t506 \t\t\t1,786 \t\t\t172 \t\nNet (increase) in loans\t(4,746)\t\t\t(1,667)\t\t\t(4,779)\t\nBusiness acquisitions, net of cash acquired\t(61)\t\t\t— \t\t\t(346)\t\nDivestitures\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t13 \t\nPurchases of equity investments and other long-term assets\t(136)\t\t\t(250)\t\t\t(216)\t\nPurchases of premises and equipment, net\t(816)\t\t\t(734)\t\t\t(811)\t\nOther, net\t117 \t\t\t51 \t\t\t241 \t\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\t12,738 \t\t\t6,816 \t\t\t(2,172)\t\nFinancing Activities:\t\t\t\t\t\nNet increase (decrease) in time deposits\t2,820 \t\t\t1,673 \t\t\t(363)\t\nNet (decrease) increase in all other deposits\t(17,311)\t\t\t(21,244)\t\t\t15,611 \t\nNet increase (decrease) in securities sold under repurchase agreements\t690 \t\t\t(398)\t\t\t(1,838)\t\nNet (decrease) increase in short-term borrowings under money market liquidity facility\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t(3,302)\t\nNet increase (decrease) in other short-term borrowings\t563 \t\t\t1,969 \t\t\t(557)\t\nNet increase (decrease) in federal funds purchased\t1,000 \t\t\t— \t\t\t— \t\nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs\t6,221 \t\t\t3,731 \t\t\t1,343 \t\nPayments for long-term debt and obligations under finance leases\t(2,545)\t\t\t(1,567)\t\t\t(1,443)\t\nPayments for redemption of preferred stock\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t(500)\t\nProceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t1,900 \t\nRepurchases of common stock\t(3,781)\t\t\t(1,500)\t\t\t(900)\t\nRepurchases of common stock for employee tax withholding\t(95)\t\t\t(123)\t\t\t(39)\t\nPayments for cash dividends\t(970)\t\t\t(972)\t\t\t(866)\t\nOther, net\t57 \t\t\t— \t\t\t— \t\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\t(13,351)\t\t\t(18,431)\t\t\t9,046 \t\nNet increase\t77 \t\t\t339 \t\t\t164 \t\nCash and due from banks at beginning of period\t3,970 \t\t\t3,631 \t\t\t3,467 \t\nCash and due from banks at end of period\t$\t4,047 \t\t\t$\t3,970 \t\t\t$\t3,631 \t\nSupplemental disclosure:\t\t\t\t\t\nInterest paid\t$\t6,184 \t\t\t$\t1,354 \t\t\t$\t37 \t\nIncome taxes paid, net\t423 \t\t\t436 \t\t\t559', 'In connection with securities lending transactions, BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement.

In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company guarantees to certain tenants the obligations of its subsidiaries for the payment of tenant improvement allowances and brokerage commissions in connection with their leases and limited costs arising from delays in delivery of their premises. The Company had letter of credit and performance obligations related to lender and development requirements that total approximately $21.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nCertain of the Company’s joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times, each partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of its interest in the joint ventures. From time to time, under certain of the Company’s joint venture agreements, if certain return thresholds are achieved, either the Company or its partners may be entitled to an additional promoted interest or payments.\nFrom time to time, the Company (or ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest) has agreed, and may in the future agree, to (1) guarantee portions of the principal, interest and other amounts in connection with their borrowings, (2) provide customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) in connection with their borrowings and (3) provide guarantees to lenders, tenants and other third parties for the completion of development projects. The Company has agreements with its outside or joint venture partners whereby the partners agree to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. In some cases, the Company earns a fee from the applicable joint venture for providing the guarantee.\nIn connection with the refinancing of 767 Fifth Avenue’s (the General Motors Building) secured loan by the Company’s consolidated joint venture entity, 767 Venture, LLC, the Company guaranteed the consolidated entity’s obligation to fund various reserves for tenant improvement costs and allowances, leasing commissions and free rent obligations in lieu of cash deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $8.5 million. The Company earns a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and has an agreement with the outside partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2023, no amounts related to the guarantee were recorded as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn connection with the development of the Company’s 290 Binney Street project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which commenced on January 5, 2023 (see Note 3), the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance requires that a building permit for the construction of a residential project of at least 400,000 square feet be issued prior to or concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for the commercial building. 290 Binney Street and the residential project are components of the Company’s future life sciences development project located in the heart of Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. When completed the Company expects the project will consist of two premier workplace properties aggregating approximately 1.1 million rentable square feet of life sciences space and the approximately 400,000 square foot residential building. The commencement of construction of each phase of the overall project is subject to various conditions, some of which are not within the Company’s control. There can be no assurance that the conditions will be satisfied or that the Company will commence the development of the remaining phases on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nOn October 2, 2023, the restructuring of Metropolitan Square was completed (See Note 6), which included, among other items, the closing of the New Mezz Loan with a maximum principal amount of $100.0 million, which loan is subordinate only to the Senior Loan. The New Mezz Loan may be drawn upon for future lease-up, operating and other costs on an as needed basis, and amounts borrowed will bear interest at a per annum rate of 12%, compounded monthly. The Company will fund 20%, or up to $20.0 million, of any amounts borrowed under the New Mezz Loan. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has funded approximately $1.7 million.', 'Net income was $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense.\n\nNet interest income increased $2.1 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in FTP credit rates on deposits as well as increases in yields on and average balances of loans. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in rates paid on deposits as well as FTP charge rates on loans.\n\nProvision for credit losses increased $164 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans, commercial and industrial loans, indirect secured consumer loans and credit card. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 68 bps for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 33 bps for the year ended December 31, 2022.', 'Provision for credit losses decreased $192 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by the impact of allocations to the business segments.\n\nNoninterest income increased $46 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by the recognition of net securities gains compared to net securities losses during the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in income from the TRA associated with Worldpay, Inc.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $184 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes due to the FDIC special assessment, compensation and benefits due to higher non-qualified deferred compensation expense and severance expense and an increase in technology and communications expense, partially offset by the impact of increases in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments.

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:\n•the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\n•the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,\n•the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and\n•the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.\n1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. The Firm is challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In August 2023 the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in the future. An appeals court is scheduled in August 2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and the Firm against that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing.\nIn addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing.\nAmrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry.\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (""DOL"") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption underthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the District Court denied certification of a class and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the District Court\'s decision is pending. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal\'s earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval.\nGovernment Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network. The Firm is responding to inquiries from civil government authorities regarding the handling of disputes related to transfers of funds through the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries and responding to requests for information.\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws.\nIn September 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement has been approved by the District Court and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part.\nOf the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume.\nJeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. In June 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement between the victim class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid $290 million to a fund for Epstein survivors. In November 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlement, rejecting objections, including those of certain state Attorneys General, regarding the victims’ releases.\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. The Firm is considering its options.\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in November 2023. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions.\nRussian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the freezing or restriction of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments on transactions that the Firm cannot make, and is contractually excused from paying, under relevant sanctions laws, with judgment entered against the Firm in one claim in February 2024. The Russian court maydisregard the parties’ contractual agreement on forum selection, and may not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. The Firm holds assets in Russia, which could be seized if the claims are granted and enforced.\nSEC Inquiries. The Firm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the Firm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds. The Firm is cooperating with the SEC in regard to both inquires.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily approved, and is subject to final court approval.\nShareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers.\nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. In December 2023, the court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\nA shareholder derivative suit was filed in May 2023 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against various officers and directors of the Firm asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based upon allegations that the defendants caused the Firm to retain Jeffrey Epstein as a client of the bank after defendants knew, or should have known, that Epstein was using the Firm’s financial services to facilitate his alleged sex trafficking activities. In December 2023, the Court dismissed the derivative action.\nA separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending.\nTrading Venues Investigations. The Firm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm self-identified that certain trading and order data through the CIB was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the CIB’s venue inventory and data completeness controls, and other remediation is underway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data not originally surveilled, which is nearly complete, and has not identified any employee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue, which largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was significant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure. The Firm expects to enter into resolutions with two U.S. regulators that will require the Firm to, among other things, complete its remediation, engage an independent consultant, and pay aggregate civil penalties of approximately $350 million. The Firm is also in advanced negotiations with a third U.S. regulator, but there is no assurance that such discussions will result in a resolution. The Firm does not expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of these resolutions. In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $1.4 billion, $266 million and $426 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.']",1203.735916991718,110774.5

The Company had letter of credit and performance obligations related to lender and development requirements that total approximately $21.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nCertain of the Company’s joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times, each partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of its interest in the joint ventures. From time to time, under certain of the Company’s joint venture agreements, if certain return thresholds are achieved, either the Company or its partners may be entitled to an additional promoted interest or payments.\nFrom time to time, the Company (or ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest) has agreed, and may in the future agree, to (1) guarantee portions of the principal, interest and other amounts in connection with their borrowings, (2) provide customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) in connection with their borrowings and (3) provide guarantees to lenders, tenants and other third parties for the completion of development projects. The Company has agreements with its outside or joint venture partners whereby the partners agree to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. In some cases, the Company earns a fee from the applicable joint venture for providing the guarantee.\nIn connection with the refinancing of 767 Fifth Avenue’s (the General Motors Building) secured loan by the Company’s consolidated joint venture entity, 767 Venture, LLC, the Company guaranteed the consolidated entity’s obligation to fund various reserves for tenant improvement costs and allowances, leasing commissions and free rent obligations in lieu of cash deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $8.5 million. The Company earns a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and has an agreement with the outside partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2023, no amounts related to the guarantee were recorded as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn connection with the development of the Company’s 290 Binney Street project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which commenced on January 5, 2023 (see Note 3), the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance requires that a building permit for the construction of a residential project of at least 400,000 square feet be issued prior to or concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for the commercial building. 290 Binney Street and the residential project are components of the Company’s future life sciences development project located in the heart of Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. When completed the Company expects the project will consist of two premier workplace properties aggregating approximately 1.1 million rentable square feet of life sciences space and the approximately 400,000 square foot residential building. The commencement of construction of each phase of the overall project is subject to various conditions, some of which are not within the Company’s control. There can be no assurance that the conditions will be satisfied or that the Company will commence the development of the remaining phases on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nOn October 2, 2023, the restructuring of Metropolitan Square was completed (See Note 6), which included, among other items, the closing of the New Mezz Loan with a maximum principal amount of $100.0 million, which loan is subordinate only to the Senior Loan. The New Mezz Loan may be drawn upon for future lease-up, operating and other costs on an as needed basis, and amounts borrowed will bear interest at a per annum rate of 12%, compounded monthly. The Company will fund 20%, or up to $20.0 million, of any amounts borrowed under the New Mezz Loan. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has funded approximately $1.7 million.', 'The Company’s leases primarily consist of noncancellable operating leases for office space with contractual terms expiring from 2024 to 2030. All of our leases are operating leases and, as a lessee, we have not entered into any sublease agreements. The lease term is defined as the fixed noncancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in an amount that appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. While some of our leases include an option to extend the lease up to five years, it is not reasonably certain that any such options will be exercised due, in part, to the dynamic nature of our sales force and rate of growth. Some of our leases contain a termination option that is not reasonably certain to be exercised. If a termination option is exercised, we remeasure the lease asset in the consolidated balance sheets using the updated lease period.

These assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.\n\nOur 2023 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50 percent was determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A 1 percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $41 million."", 'Pension Benefits — We sponsor a number of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The benefits provided under these plans are based primarily on years of service and compensation levels. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to trustees or are paid directly by us from general funds. In 1999, we implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings credit continued to accrue for fifteen years for certain active employees participating in the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments. Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Effective as of January 1, 2011, our U.S. pension plans were amended so that employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the plans. All collective bargaining units adopted this amendment by December 31, 2011.\nIn June 2023, we settled $245 million of our pension benefit obligations associated with approximately 6,000 retired participants that were receiving benefits within our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. A group annuity contract was purchased on behalf of these participants with a third-party insurance provider and funded directly by $241 million from the assets of our pension plans, resulting in an actuarial gain of $4 million.\nPostretirement Benefits — We provide postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance to eligible retired U.S. employees, and where applicable, their dependents. Accordingly, we sponsor a retiree medical program for eligible retired U.S. employees and fund applicable retiree medical accounts intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses on a tax-favored basis for retirees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements. Effective as of January 1, 2019, we no longer sponsor our own retiree medical coverage for substantially all retired U.S. employees that are Medicare eligible. Instead, we offer these Medicare-eligible retirees access to health care coverage through a private exchange and offer a health reimbursement account to subsidize benefits for a select group of such retirees. We also provide postretirement life insurance to all eligible U.S. employees who retired prior to January 1, 2018, as well as certain eligible retired employees covered by one of our collective bargaining agreements who retired prior to January 1, 2023.\nDetermining net periodic benefit expense (income) is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.', 'As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 52,000 employees, with approximately 45% in the U.S. and 55% outside of the U.S.  Approximately 62% of our employees work in our brokerage segment and 15% in our risk management segment.  Our remaining employees work in our corporate segment, primarily at our headquarters and at Gallagher Centers of Excellence in India.  In 2023, our total compensation expense was $4,769.1 million for the brokerage segment and $776.8 million for the risk management segment, representing 55% and 60%, respectively, of brokerage and risk management segment revenues.  Additional information regarding compensation expense, both on a reported and an adjusted basis can be found elsewhere in this report under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.', 'The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $36 million.\n\nBased on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.\n\nPension benefits are further described in Note 24 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLegal and other contingencies:    We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods.

114,114,34763c7c,"The outcomes of historical legal cases affect ongoing disputes and settlements/losses, especially for AbbVie.","The historical resolution of similar cases can provide useful context for evaluating current legal risks, even though each case has its own facts and legal nuances. For example, the dismissal of the Bystolic litigation—with the court dismissing the case with prejudice—indicates that some of the antitrust and unfair trade claims regarding patent litigation settlements may not ultimately succeed, either because the claims are deemed legally insufficient or because the evidence fails to support the allegations. This historical outcome can inform expectations in several ways:

1. Risk Assessment: The dismissal suggests that when similar claims are brought against a company, there might be a precedent or judicial skepticism regarding the validity of such claims. This can lower the anticipated monetary losses if courts are likely to dismiss the claims before reaching a settlement, though it does not eliminate risk entirely.

2. Settlement Negotiations: Past outcomes such as dismissals can bolster a company’s negotiating position. If a company can point to similar cases that ended in dismissal, it might argue that current lawsuits have a lower probability of causing large settlements or adverse judgments. However, each lawsuit is subject to its own set of legal challenges and local court findings.

3. Financial Forecasting: While dismissed cases reduce expected liabilities, ongoing litigation (such as those related to Niaspan and AndroGel) involve factors that might differ in scope, jurisdiction, or legal claims. Historical resolution may reduce the estimated loss or reserve amounts set aside for litigation risk, but each case’s unique aspects must be factored in. No direct calculations (such as dollar amounts for settlements) can be made from the given data, but qualitative risk metrics can be adjusted based on the precedent of dismissals.

4. Legal Strategy and Confidence: A dismissal sets a precedent that can influence both plaintiffs’ and defendants’ strategies. For plaintiffs, it might mean being more cautious in pursuing claims under certain legal theories. For defendants, it could encourage a strategy aimed at seeking dismissal based on prior case law. This strategic backdrop is useful for financial analysts who review litigation reserves and risk disclosures in a company’s financial statements.

In summary, while the historical dismissal of the Bystolic litigation does not guarantee a similar outcome for other ongoing cases, it does suggest that some antitrust claims related to patent litigation settlements may face significant hurdles in court. This precedent can help shape expectations by potentially lowering the estimated risk of large settlements or adverse judgments, but ongoing litigation must still be monitored closely, and reserves adjusted as appropriate.","[""Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of six individual plaintiff lawsuits and a certified class action by Niaspan direct purchasers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees.\n\nIn August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v.

Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of six individual plaintiff lawsuits and a certified class action by Niaspan direct purchasers.

Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, we have in the past and could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nClaims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations.\nWe are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. There continues to be a significant volume of government investigations and litigation against companies operating in our industry, both in the U.S. and around the world. Government investigations and actions have and could result in substantial criminal and civil fines and/or criminal charges, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions, as well as reputational harm, including as a result of increased public interest in the matter. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.\nOur sales and marketing activities, the pricing of our products and other aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the FCPA and other federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the Anti-Kickback Statute, anti-bribery laws, the False Claims Act, and similar laws in international jurisdictions. In addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws, the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation, settlement precedent, advisory opinions, and special fraud alerts. Our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments.\nRequirements or industry standards in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions. If an interaction is found to be improper, government enforcement actions and penalties could result. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time-to-time received, and may receive in the future, inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities. In addition, we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities, brought by governmental authorities, as well as consumers and private payors. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. Such claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged non-compliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product (approved and unapproved) information, potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including social media, mobile applications and blogger outreach.\nIn connection with the resolution of a U.S. government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, in 2018, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (OIG), which expired in May 2023. Pfizer submitted its final annual report and is awaiting a response from the OIG.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claims and proceedings, including environmental contingencies. Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. While we have accrued for\nworldwide legal liabilities, no guarantee exists that additional costs will not be incurred or additional payments will not be required beyond the amounts accrued.', 'We are subject to various unresolved legal actions and investigations, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos related liability), employment, patent, trademark, and antitrust matters (including class action litigation). Currently we believe the reasonably possible range of losses for unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on our financial statements; however, the outcome of any current or future proceedings, claims, or investigations cannot be predicted with certainty. Adverse decisions in one or more of these proceedings, claims, or investigations could require us to pay substantial damages or fines, undertake service actions, initiate recall campaigns, or take other costly actions. It is therefore possible that legal judgments or investigations could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered by our insurance programs and could affect our financial position and results.', ""We are currently involved in various claims, investigations and legal proceedings, including the matters described below. For information as to our accounting policies relating to claims and legal proceedings, including use of estimates and contingencies, please read Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to these consolidated financial statements.\nWith respect to some loss contingencies, an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made until management has further information, including, for example, (i) which claims, if any, will survive dispositive motion practice; (ii) information to be obtained through discovery; (iii) information as to the parties' damages claims and supporting evidence; (iv) the parties’ legal theories; and (v) the parties' settlement positions. If an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can be made at this time, it is included in the potential loss contingency description below.\nThe claims and legal proceedings in which we are involved also include challenges to the scope, validity or enforceability of the patents relating to our products, pipeline or processes and challenges to the scope, validity or enforceability of the patents held by others. These include claims by third-parties that we infringe their patents. An adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could result in one or more of the following and have a material impact on our business or consolidated results of operations and financial position: (i) loss of patent protection; (ii) inability to continue to engage in certain activities; and (iii) payment of significant damages, royalties, penalties and/or license fees to third parties.\nLoss Contingencies\nADUHELM Securities Litigation\nWe and certain current and former officers are defendants in two actions related to ADUHELM filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the District Court). Both actions allege violations of federal securities laws under 15 U.S.C. §78j(b) and §78t(a) and 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5 and seek declarations of the actions as class actions and monetary relief. In October 2023 the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed in part and affirmed in part the dismissal of the shareholder action related to ADUHELM that was filed in November 2020. In March 2023 the District Court dismissed the shareholder action that was filed in February 2022. In May 2023 the plaintiff filed a motion to alter the judgment and amend the complaint, which is pending.\nDerivative Actions\nWe and members of the Board of Directors are named as defendants in derivative actions filed by shareholders in February and July 2022, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The actions allege violations of federal securities laws under 15 U.S.C. §78n(a) and 17 C.F.R. §240 14.a-9, and breaches of fiduciary duties and waste of corporate assets, and seek declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary relief payable to Biogen, and attorneys’ fees and costs payable to the plaintiffs. The Court has stayed both cases.\nIMRALDI Patent Litigation\nIn June 2022 Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH (Fresenius Kabi) filed a claim for damages and injunctive relief against Biogen France SAS in the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris, alleging that IMRALDI, the adalimumab biosimilar product of Samsung Bioepis that Biogen commercializes in Europe, infringes the French counterpart of European Patent 3 145 488 (the EP ‘488 Patent), which expires in May 2035. In August 2022 Fresenius Kabi filed a claim for damages and injunctive relief against Biogen GmbH in the Düsseldorf Regional Court, alleging infringement of the German counterpart of the EP '488 Patent. A hearing in the Düsseldorf Regional Court was held in December 2023 and a decision is pending. The EP '488 Patent is the subject of opposition proceedings in the EPO Technical Boards of Appeal.Litigation with Former Convergence Shareholders\nIn 2015 Biogen acquired Convergence, a U.K. company. In 2019 Shareholder Representative Services LLC, on behalf of the former shareholders of Convergence, asserted claims of $200.0 million for alleged breaches of the contract pursuant to which we acquired Convergence. In June 2023 Shareholder Representative Services LLC and 24 former shareholders filed suit against us in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales on one of the previously asserted claims, seeking payment of $49.9 million, interest and costs.\nERISA Class Action Litigation\nIn 2020 participants in the Biogen 401(k) Savings Plan filed actions against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA and seeking a declaration of the actions as class actions and monetary and other relief. In January 2024 the Court granted final approval of a settlement under which we agreed to pay $9.75 million without any admission of liability and dismissed the actions with prejudice.\nHumana Patient Assistance Litigation\nIn March 2023 the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed the previously disclosed action filed against us by Humana in September 2020. Humana had alleged damages related to our providing MS patients with free medications and making charitable contributions to non-profit organizations that assist MS patients and had alleged violations of the federal RICO Act and state laws. In December 2023 Humana appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and the appeal is pending.\nGenentech Litigation\nIn February 2023 Genentech, Inc. filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that it is owed royalties on sales of TYSABRI that occurred after the expiration of a patent licensed by Genentech to Biogen, together with interest and costs. The Company estimates that the royalties claimed total approximately $88.3 million.\nBardoxolone Securities Litigation\nIn 2021 and 2022 putative stockholders of Reata (later acquired by Biogen) filed litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging violations of the federal securities laws by Reata, certain former officers and directors and certain underwriters under 15 U.S.C. §78j(b) and §78t(a), 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5, and 15 U.S.C. §§77k, 77l(a)(2) and 77o in connection with Reata's asset bardoxolone. Plaintiffs seek declaration of the actions as a class actions and monetary relief. In October 2023 the parties reached a settlement providing for payment by Reata of $45.0 million without any admission of liability. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement in November 2023 and has set a final fairness hearing for March 2024. We expect a portion of the payment to be reimbursed under Reata's insurance coverage.\nLender Dispute\nOne of Reata's lenders claims that approximately $23.3 million is owing under a loan agreement with Reata.\nOther Matters\nGovernment Investigations\nThe Company has received subpoenas from the SEC seeking information relating to ADUHELM and its launch. The Company has received a subpoena from the DOJ seeking information relating to our business operations in several foreign countries. The Company is also providing information relating to our business operations in several foreign countries to the SEC.\nTYSABRI Biosimilar Patent Matter\nIn September 2022 we filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Sandoz Inc., other Sandoz entities and Polpharma Biologics S.A. under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, 42 U.S.C. §262, seeking a declaratory judgment of patent infringement.\nAnnulment Proceedings in the General Court of the European Union relating to TECFIDERA\nIn November 2020 Mylan Ireland filed an action in the General Court of the European Union to annul the EMA's decision not to validate its applications to market generic versions of TECFIDERA on the grounds that TECFIDERA benefits from regulatory data protection.Hatch-Waxman Act Litigation relating to VUMERITY Orange-Book Listed Patents\nIn July 2023 Biogen and Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited filed patent infringement proceedings relating to VUMERITY Orange-Book listed patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,669,281, 9,090,558 and 10,080,733) pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Zydus Worldwide DMCC.\nProduct Liability and Other Legal Proceedings\nWe are also involved in product liability claims and other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal business activities. While the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition."", 'We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These claims or proceedings can involve various types of parties, including governments, competitors, customers, suppliers, service providers, licensees, employees, or shareholders, among others. These matters may involve patent infringement, antitrust, securities, pricing, access, sales and marketing practices, environmental, commercial, contractual rights, licensing obligations, health and safety matters, consumer fraud, employment matters, product liability, insurance coverage, and regulatory compliance, among others. The resolution of these matters often develops over a long period of time and expectations can change as a result of new findings, rulings, appeals or settlement arrangements. Legal proceedings that are significant or that we believe could become significant or material are described below.\nWe are defending against the legal proceedings in which we are named as defendants vigorously. It is not possible to determine the final outcome of these matters, and we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for any of these matters; however, we believe that the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.\nLitigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. With respect to the product liability claims currently asserted against us, we have accrued for our estimated exposures to the extent they are both probable and reasonably estimable based on the information available to us. We accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability loss contingencies are accrued when both probable and reasonably estimable.\nBecause of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of additional product liability and related claims in the future. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently and previously marketed products.\nPatent Litigation\nEmgality Patent Litigation\nWe are a named defendant in litigation filed by Teva Pharmaceuticals International GMBH and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (collectively, Teva) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a ruling that various claims in three different Teva patents would be infringed by our launch and continued sales of Emgality for the prevention of migraine in adults.\nFollowing a trial, in November 2022, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Teva. In September 2023, the court granted our motion to overrule the jury verdict and found all asserted claims of the three patents invalid. Teva has appealed the decision. This matter is ongoing.\nIn June 2021, we were named as a defendant in a second litigation filed by Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a ruling that two of Teva\'s patents, which are directed toward use of the active ingredient in Emgality to treat migraine, would be infringed by our continued sales of Emgality. We challenged these two patents by filing requests for Inter Partes Review with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) and in October 2022, the PTAB granted our requests. In September 2023, the PTAB issued decisions finding all claims of both patents invalid. Teva has agreed not to appeal the decisions and has dismissed the corresponding district court litigation. This matter is closed.\nEnvironmental Proceedings\nUnder the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as ""Superfund,"" we have been designated as one of several potentially responsible parties with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites. Under Superfund, each responsible party may be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the cleanup.\nOther Matters\nActos® Litigation\nWe are named along with Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. and Takeda affiliates (collectively, Takeda) in a third party payor class action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Plaintiffs claim that they and similarly situated class members are entitled to recover money paid for or to reimburse Actos prescriptions because of alleged concealment of bladder cancer risk. Our agreement with Takeda calls for Takeda to defend and indemnify us against our losses and expenses with respect to U.S. litigation arising out of the manufacture, use, or sale of Actos and other related expenses in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In August 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted our and Takeda\'s petition for permission to appeal the class certification order, and briefing was submitted in January 2024. This matter is ongoing.\nMounjaro and Trulicity Product Liability Litigation\nWe, along with Novo Nordisk A/S (Novo) and other related Novo entities, are named in numerous lawsuits by plaintiffs alleging injuries following purported use of incretin products. Certain complaints name us and allege injuries that plaintiffs claim are associated with the use of Mounjaro and/or Trulicity. These lawsuits were filed beginning in August 2023 and are pending in various federal courts. In February 2024, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation established Multi-District Litigation for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This matter is ongoing.\n340B Litigation and Investigations\nWe are the plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in January 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Secretary of HHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and the Administrator of HRSA. The lawsuit challenges HHS\'s December 30, 2020 advisory opinion stating that drug manufacturers are required to deliver discounts under the 340B program to all contract pharmacies and HHS\'s Administrative Dispute Resolution regulations. We seek a declaratory judgment that the defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution, a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the administrative dispute resolution process created by defendants and, with it, their application of the advisory opinion, and other related relief. In March 2021, the court entered an order preliminarily enjoining the government\'s enforcement of the administrative dispute resolution process against us. In May 2021, HRSA sent us an enforcement letter notifying us that it determined that our policy was contrary to the 340B statute. In response, in May 2021, we amended our complaint to bring claims related to HRSA\'s determination. In June 2021, the defendants withdrew the HHS December 30, 2020 advisory opinion. In July 2021, the court held oral argument on the parties\' cross motions for summary judgment and the defendants\' motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the court denied the defendants\' motion to dismiss, and granted in part and denied in part the parties\' cross motions for summary judgment. Both parties filed notices of appeal related to the court\'s summary judgment order. In October 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held oral argument. This matter is ongoing.\nWe, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers, have been named as a defendant in petitions filed in 2021 and 2023 and currently pending before the HHS Administrative Dispute Resolution Panel. Petitioners seek declaratory, injunctive, and/or monetary relief related to the 340B program. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana has entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the government\'s enforcement of this administrative dispute resolution process against us.\nIn July 2021, we, along with Sanofi-Aventis U.S., LLC (Sanofi), Novo Nordisk Inc. (Novo Nordisk), and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP (AstraZeneca), were named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York by Mosaic Health, Inc. alleging antitrust and unjust enrichment claims related to the defendants\' 340B distribution programs. We, with Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, and AstraZeneca, filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was granted in September 2022. In October 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint. In January 2024, the court denied the motion for leave to amend and dismissed the case.\nWe received a civil investigative subpoena in February 2021 from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Vermont relating to the sale of pharmaceutical products to Vermont covered entities under the 340B program. We are cooperating with this subpoena.\nBranchburg Manufacturing Facility\nIn May 2021, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting the production of certain documents relating to our manufacturing site in Branchburg, New Jersey. We are cooperating with the subpoena.\nBrazil Litigation – Cosmopolis Facility\nLabor Attorney Litigation\nFirst initiated in 2008, Eli Lilly do Brasil Limitada (Lilly Brasil) is named in a Public Civil Action brought by the Labor Public Attorney (LPA) alleging harm to employees and former employees caused by alleged exposure to soil and groundwater contaminants at a former manufacturing facility in Cosmopolis, operated by the company between 1977 and 2003. In May 2014, the trial Court ruled against Lilly Brasil, ordering it to undertake several remedial and compensatory actions, including health coverage for a class of individuals and certain of their children. In July 2018, the appeals court generally affirmed the trial Court\'s ruling, which included a liquidated award of 300 million Brazilian reais, which, when adjusted for inflation, is approximately 1.26 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $260 million as of December 31, 2023). In August 2019, Lilly Brasil appealed to the superior labor court (TST) and in June 2021, the majority of the elements of Lilly Brasil\'s appeal were admitted; elements not proceeding are subject to an interlocutory appeal to the TST that was filed in June 2021. Mediation hearings are ongoing.\nIn July 2019, at the LPA\'s request, the trial Court ordered a freeze of Lilly Brasil’s immovable property in the amount of 500 million Brazilian reais, which was reduced on Lilly Brasil\'s appeal and, when adjusted for inflation, is approximately 131 million Brazilian reais (approximately $27 million as of December 31, 2023). The parties appealed to the TST, which appeal is under review. The trial Court is currently assessing the status of Lilly Brasil’s compliance with the obligations as to the land and an inspection in the industrial plant occurred in October 2023. These matters are ongoing.\nIndividual Former Employee Litigation\nLilly Brasil is also named in various pending lawsuits filed in the trial Court by individual former employees making related claims. These individual lawsuits are at various stages in the litigation process.\nPuerto Rico Tax Matter\nIn May 2013, the Municipality of Carolina in Puerto Rico (Municipality) filed a lawsuit against us alleging noncompliance with respect to a contract with the Municipality and seeking a declaratory judgment. In December 2020, the Puerto Rico Appellate Court (AP) reversed the summary judgment previously granted by the Court of First Instance (CFI) in our favor, dismissing the Municipality\'s complaint in its entirety. The AP remanded the case to the CFI for trial on the merits. The trial began in May 2022; however, the Municipality filed a new motion requesting the CFI to execute an alleged judgment. The request was denied by the CFI in our favor and the Municipality filed for revision at the AP, which we opposed, staying the case. The AP denied the Municipality\'s motion for revision. This matter is ongoing and trial has been scheduled for August 2024.\nAverage Manufacturer Price Litigation\nIn November 2014, we, along with another pharmaceutical manufacturer, were named as co-defendants in United States et al. ex rel. Streck v. Takeda Pharm. Am., Inc., et al., which was filed in November 2014 and unsealed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges that the defendants should have treated certain credits from distributors as retroactive price increases and included such increases in calculating average manufacturer prices. Following a trial in August 2022, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Lilly appealed to the Seventh Circuit and the appeal is pending. This matter is ongoing.\nHealth Choice Alliance\nWe are named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in Texas and New Jersey state courts in October 2019 seeking damages under the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act and New Jersey Medicaid False Claims Act, respectively, for certain patient support programs related to our products Humalog, Humulin, and Forteo. The Texas state court action has been stayed. The New Jersey state court action was dismissed with prejudice pending an ongoing appeal before the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. This matter is ongoing.\nPricing Litigation\nWe, along with Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, and, in some matters, certain pharmacy benefit managers, have been named in numerous lawsuits, including putative class actions, by states and state attorneys general, counties, municipalities, third-party payers, consumers, and other parties related to insulin pricing and rebates paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers. These lawsuits assert various theories, including consumer protection and deceptive trade practice, fraud, false advertising, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy, federal and state RICO statutes, antitrust, and unfair competition claims. These lawsuits have been brought in various state and federal courts since 2017 and are at various stages in the litigation process. Starting in August 2023 after a ruling by the Judicial Panel for Multi-District Litigation, several of these cases were transferred to or filed in the District of New Jersey for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. In May 2023, we reached a settlement in the In re Insulin Pricing Litigation consumer class action. A motion for preliminary approval of our settlement is pending. In January 2024, the Multi-District Litigation court denied the consumer class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and ordered the parties to submit briefs addressing the impact of that denial on the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. In February 2024, we entered into a non-monetary settlement with the Minnesota Attorney General\'s Office that resolved all matters related to Minnesota\'s insulin pricing lawsuit.\nInvestigations, Subpoenas, and Inquiries\nWe have been subject to various investigations and received subpoenas, civil investigative demand requests, information requests, interrogatories, and other inquiries from various governmental entities related to pricing issues, including the pricing and sale of insulins and other products and calculations of AMP and best price. These include subpoenas from the Vermont Attorney General Office, civil investigative demands from the Washington, New Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Texas and Ohio Attorney General Offices, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, as well as information requests from the Mississippi, Washington D.C., California, Florida, Hawaii, and Nevada Attorney General Offices.\nIn January 2022, the Michigan Attorney General filed a petition in Michigan state court seeking authorization to investigate Lilly for potential violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), and a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the Attorney General has authority to investigate Lilly\'s sale of insulin under the MCPA. The court authorized the proposed investigation and the issuance of civil investigative subpoenas. In April 2022, the parties entered into a stipulation providing that the State of Michigan will not issue any civil investigative subpoena to us under the MCPA until the declaratory judgment action is resolved. In July 2022, the court dismissed the case in its entirety. In June 2023, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in our favor. In August 2023, the Michigan Attorney General filed an application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, which is being set for argument.\nWe are cooperating with all of the aforementioned investigations, subpoenas, and inquiries.\nResearch Corporation Technologies, Inc.\nIn April 2016, we were named as a defendant in litigation filed by Research Corporation Technologies, Inc. (RCT) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. RCT is seeking damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and conversion related to processes used to manufacture certain products, including Humalog and Humulin. In October 2021, the court issued a summary judgment decision in favor of RCT on certain issues, including with respect to a disputed royalty. Trial is scheduled for August 2024. Potential damages payable under the litigation, if finally awarded after an appeal, could be material but are not currently reasonably estimable. This matter is ongoing.', 'From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, inquiries and claims concerning environmental contamination as well as litigation and allegations in connection with acquisitions, product liability, manufacturing or packaging defects, and claims for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of any of which could be significant. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against any such litigation and do not currently believe that the outcome of any such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

Any legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the Company’s view of these matters and their potential effects may change in the future. The Company records a liability for contingencies when a loss is deemed to be probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a License and Settlement Agreement (“Settlement”) to resolve certain patent-related litigation. The payment terms under the Settlement consisted of 8 quarterly payments of $45 million that began in the second quarter of 2022. The final remaining quarterly payment will be paid in the first quarter of 2024 and is included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.', 'In addition to the above, in the ordinary course of our operations, we are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations, and proceedings, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, patent infringement claims, government investigations, labor and employment claims, breach of contract claims, tax, and other matters. Regardless of the outcome, these proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Although the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as litigation and events related thereto unfold; we currently do not believe that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.', 'Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include significant monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and overall trends. No material accrual has been recorded as of April 26, 2024 related to such matters.', 'The outcome of any such proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain; therefore, assessing the likelihood of loss and any estimated damages is difficult and subject to considerable judgment. We describe below those legal matters for which a material loss is either (i) possible but not probable, and/or (ii) not reasonably estimable at this time.\n\nPfizer/BioNTech Patent Litigation\n\nIn August 2022, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Pfizer Inc.

(collectively, BioNTech), asserting infringement of certain U.S. patents concerning our mRNA platform technology and disease-specific vaccine designs in Pfizer and BioNTech’s manufacture and sale of their mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

Some of these proceedings may be class actions, and some involve claims for large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and they may remain unresolved for several years. Legal proceedings in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters.

Revenue per Employee = Total Revenue / 33,000

Our latest estimates indicate that we will be near the low end of that range, and the full benefits will not be realized until we complete the closure of a manufacturing facility, which is expected of occur in 2025.', '2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\n(in millions)\nOperating Revenues:\t\t\t\t\t\nRetail electric revenues\t$\t16,343 \t\t\t$\t18,197 \t\t\t$\t14,852 \t\nWholesale electric revenues\t2,467 \t\t\t3,641 \t\t\t2,455 \t\nOther electric revenues\t792 \t\t\t747 \t\t\t718 \t\nNatural gas revenues\t4,702 \t\t\t5,962 \t\t\t4,380 \t\nOther revenues\t949 \t\t\t732 \t\t\t708 \t\nTotal operating revenues\t25,253 \t\t\t29,279 \t\t\t23,113 \t\nOperating Expenses:\t\t\t\t\t\nFuel\t4,365 \t\t\t6,835 \t\t\t4,010 \t\nPurchased power\t883 \t\t\t1,593 \t\t\t978 \t\nCost of natural gas\t1,644 \t\t\t3,004 \t\t\t1,619 \t\nCost of other sales\t560 \t\t\t396 \t\t\t357 \t\nOther operations and maintenance\t6,093 \t\t\t6,573 \t\t\t5,902 \t\nDepreciation and amortization\t4,525 \t\t\t3,663 \t\t\t3,565 \t\nTaxes other than income taxes\t1,425 \t\t\t1,411 \t\t\t1,290 \t\nEstimated loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4\t(68)\t\t\t183 \t\t\t1,692 \t\nImpairment charges\t— \t\t\t251 \t\t\t2 \t\nTotal operating expenses\t19,427 \t\t\t23,909 \t\t\t19,415 \t\nOperating Income\t5,826 \t\t\t5,370 \t\t\t3,698 \t\nOther Income and (Expense):\t\t\t\t\t\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\t268 \t\t\t224 \t\t\t190 \t\nEarnings from equity method investments\t144 \t\t\t151 \t\t\t76 \t\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\t(2,446)\t\t\t(2,022)\t\t\t(1,837)\t\nOther income (expense), net\t553 \t\t\t500 \t\t\t449 \t\nTotal other income and (expense)\t(1,481)\t\t\t(1,147)\t\t\t(1,122)\t\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\t4,345 \t\t\t4,223 \t\t\t2,576 \t\nIncome taxes\t496 \t\t\t795 \t\t\t267 \t\nConsolidated Net Income\t3,849 \t\t\t3,428 \t\t\t2,309 \t\nDividends on preferred stock of subsidiaries\t— \t\t\t11 \t\t\t15 \t\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\t(127)\t\t\t(107)\t\t\t(99)\t\nConsolidated Net Income Attributable to Southern Company\t$\t3,976 \t\t\t$\t3,524 \t\t\t$\t2,393 \t\nCommon Stock Data:\t\t\t\t\t\nEarnings per share —\t\t\t\t\t\nBasic\t$\t3.64 \t\t\t$\t3.28 \t\t\t$\t2.26 \t\nDiluted\t3.62 \t\t\t3.26 \t\t\t2.24 \t\nAverage number of shares of common stock outstanding — (in millions)\t\t\t\t\t\nBasic\t1,092 \t\t\t1,075 \t\t\t1,061 \t\nDiluted\t1,098 \t\t\t1,081 \t\t\t1,068', ""Years Ended December 31,\n2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nOPERATING REVENUES\t\t$\t28,114 \t\t\t$\t20,956 \t\t\t$\t17,069 \t\nOPERATING EXPENSES\t\t \t\t \t\t \nFuel, purchased power and interchange\t\t5,457 \t\t\t6,389 \t\t\t4,527 \t\nOther operations and maintenance\t\t4,681 \t\t\t4,428 \t\t\t3,981 \t\nDepreciation and amortization\t\t5,879 \t\t\t4,503 \t\t\t3,924 \t\nTaxes other than income taxes and other – net\t\t2,265 \t\t\t2,077 \t\t\t1,801 \t\nTotal operating expenses – net\t\t18,282 \t\t\t17,397 \t\t\t14,233 \t\nGAINS ON DISPOSAL OF BUSINESSES/ASSETS – NET\t\t405 \t\t\t522 \t\t\t77 \t\nOPERATING INCOME\t\t10,237 \t\t\t4,081 \t\t\t2,913 \t\nOTHER INCOME (DEDUCTIONS)\t\t \t\t \t\t \nInterest expense\t\t(3,324)\t\t\t(585)\t\t\t(1,270)\t\nEquity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees\t\t(648)\t\t\t203 \t\t\t666 \t\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\t\t161 \t\t\t112 \t\t\t142 \t\nGains on disposal of investments and other property – net\n125 \t\t\t80 \t\t\t70 \t\nChange in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net\t\t159 \t\t\t(461)\t\t\t267 \t\nOther net periodic benefit income\t\t245 \t\t\t202 \t\t\t257 \t\nOther – net\t\t333 \t\t\t200 \t\t\t130 \t\nTotal other income (deductions) – net\t\t(2,949)\t\t\t(249)\t\t\t262 \t\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\t\t7,288 \t\t\t3,832 \t\t\t3,175 \t\nINCOME TAXES\t\t1,006 \t\t\t586 \t\t\t348 \t\nNET INCOME\t\t6,282 \t\t\t3,246 \t\t\t2,827 \t\nNET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\t\t1,028 \t\t\t901 \t\t\t746 \t\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEE\t\t$\t7,310 \t\t\t$\t4,147 \t\t\t$\t3,573 \t\nEarnings per share attributable to NEE:\t\t \t\t \t\t \nBasic\t\t$\t3.61 \t\t\t$\t2.10 \t\t\t$\t1.82 \t\nAssuming dilution\t\t$\t3.60 \t\t\t$\t2.10 \t\t\t$\t1.81"", 'In light of the Second Circuit decision, the Company recorded a charge to earnings of $267 in the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which is comprised of the recalculation of benefits and interest.

The decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the Retirement Plan, which based on the current funded status of the Retirement Plan will require no immediate cash contribution by the Company. In June 2023, the Company filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court requesting permission for an appeal to that court and that petition was denied in October 2023. Also in June 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a revised final judgment in the District Court to address certain unresolved calculation issues, which the Company opposed.', 'Note 3 – Earnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\n2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\nNumerator:\t\t\t\t\t\nNet income\t$\t93,736 \t\t\t$\t96,995 \t\t\t$\t99,803 \t\nDenominator:\t\t\t\t\t\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding\t15,343,783 \t\t\t15,744,231 \t\t\t16,215,963 \t\nEffect of dilutive share-based awards\t64,312 \t\t\t68,316 \t\t\t109,856 \t\nWeighted-average diluted shares\t15,408,095 \t\t\t15,812,547 \t\t\t16,325,819 \t\nBasic earnings per share\t$\t6.11 \t\t\t$\t6.16 \t\t\t$\t6.15 \t\nDiluted earnings per share\t$\t6.08 \t\t\t$\t6.13 \t\t\t$\t6.11 \t\n \nApproximately 24 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.', 'We believe that hiring people who share our corporate purpose of helping clients achieve their financial goals is an essential element of executing our “Through Clients’ Eyes” strategy, and we seek to attract, retain, and motivate the talent Schwab needs to successfully serve our clients and grow our business.

The fair value of these securities was approximately $649 billion and $694 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.

This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks.

On March 10, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5 billion under a new share repurchase program (the “2022 Program”), which replaced a previously authorized share repurchase program (the “2018 Program”). The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs.

Changes in AOCI increased shareholders' equity by $531 million, primarily due to available for sale securities and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during 2023. Common stock repurchased during 2023 decreased shareholders' equity by $252 million. These shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock. The cumulative effect from the adoption of new accounting guidance that eliminated TDRs and created modifications to troubled borrowers increased shareholders' equity by $28 million.\nTotal equity includes noncontrolling interest of $64 million and $4 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The noncontrolling interest represents the unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which Regions held the majority interest at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Total vehicle sales data for periods presented prior to 2022 reflect courtesy transportation vehicles used by U.S. dealers in their business.

In fiscal year 2024, the Company recognized a charge of $13 million for the accelerated depreciation of certain fixed assets which was recorded to Cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized a charge of $85 million for the accelerated depreciation of certain fixed assets, of which $60 million and $25 million was recorded to Cost of revenue and Product development, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In fiscal year 2022, the accelerated depreciation charge recognized was immaterial. Interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures is capitalized as part of the cost of the qualified assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company capitalized interest of $9 million, $8 million and $3 million, respectively.', 'Depreciation is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings and related improvements range from seven years to 30 years and for furniture, fixtures and equipment range from three years to seven years.', 'Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from one to 39 years. The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with the asset cost. The Company’s assets acquired under finance leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset life or lease term (which is reasonably assured) and included in depreciation. The Company records capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property and equipment and depreciates the net asset over the estimated useful lives of the associated assets.\n\nThe Company periodically evaluates the period over which it expects to recover the economic value of the Company’s property and equipment, considering factors such as changes in machinery and equipment technology, the ability to re-use equipment across generations of process technology and historical usage trends.

For certain of our acquisitions, we have identified cost savings and synergies as a result of integrating the company with our existing business that provide additional value to the combined entity. In many cases, acquiring companies with these characteristics will result in purchase prices that include a significant amount of goodwill.\n\nOur acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition. The purchase prices were allocated to the net assets acquired based upon estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for the acquisitions made during the year ended December 31, 2023 are preliminary as we are in the process of determining the following: 1) valuation amounts for certain receivables, inventories and fixed assets acquired; 2) valuation amounts for certain intangible assets acquired; 3) the acquisition date fair value of certain liabilities assumed; and 4) the tax basis of the entities acquired. We have recorded preliminary estimates for certain of the items noted above and will record adjustments, if any, to the preliminary amounts upon finalization of the valuations.', 'Off-market Customer Contracts. We have identified certain contractual obligations with customers with economic returns that are higher or lower than could be realized in market transactions as of the acquisition date and have recorded liabilities for the preliminary acquisition date fair value of the off-market components. The preliminary acquisition date fair value of the off-market components is a net liability of $95 million, consisting of $37 million and $58 million included in the “Other accrued items” and “Other long-term liabilities” line items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively, and excludes any amounts already recognized in forward loss provisions (see discussion in the preceding paragraph). We measured the fair value of these components as the amount by which the terms of the contract with the customer deviates from the terms that a market participant could have achieved at the acquisition date. The off-market components of these contracts will be recognized as an increase to revenue as we incur costs to satisfy the associated performance obligations. We recognized $14 million from amortization of off-market contract liabilities during the period from the acquisition date through December 29, 2023.', 'Contract and Other Customer Acquisition Costs\n\nWe defer costs to acquire retail contracts and amortize these costs over the expected life of the contract.

The deferred acquisition and contract cost balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $97 million and $89 million, respectively. The amortization related to these costs during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 totaled $88 million, $83 million and $75 million respectively, recorded as SG&A expenses, and $6 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, recorded as a reduction to operating revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nPractical Expedients', 'Reinsurance premiums assumed are based on information provided by ceding companies supplemented by our own estimates of premium when we have not received ceding company reports.

Policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income including investment income. Unrecoverable policy acquisition costs are expensed in the period identified.', ""Dx\nWithin the Dx segment, a revenue transaction is initiated when Dx receives a requisition order to perform a diagnostic test. The information provided on the requisition form is used to determine the party that will be billed for the testing performed and the expected reimbursement. Dx recognizes revenue and satisfies its performance obligation for services rendered when the testing process is complete and the associated results are reported. The Dx segment also enters into lab management agreements which have monthly and non-testing based fees which are recognized each month as the services are provided. Revenues are distributed among four payer portfolios - clients, patients, Medicare and Medicaid and third party. Dx considers negotiated discounts and anticipated adjustments, including historical collection experience for the payer portfolio, when revenues are recorded.\nThe following are descriptions of the Dx payer portfolios:\nClients\nClient payers represent the portion of Dx’s revenue related to physicians, hospitals, health systems, accountable care organizations, employers and other entities where payment is received exclusively from the entity ordering the testing service. Generally, client revenues are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at Dx’s client list price, less any negotiated discount. A portion of client billing is for laboratory management services, collection kits and other non-testing services or products. In these cases, revenue is recognized when services are rendered or delivered.\nPatients\nThis portfolio includes revenue from uninsured patients and member cost-share for insured patients (e.g., coinsurance, deductibles and non-covered services). Uninsured patients are billed based upon Dx’s patient fee schedules, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. Dx bills insured patients as directed by their health plan and after consideration of the fees and terms associated with an established health plan contract.\nMedicare and Medicaid\nThis portfolio relates to fee-for-service revenue from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs. Net revenue from these programs is based on the fee schedule established by the related government authority. In addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials are considered when determining net revenue. Any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. These adjustments are not material to Dx’s results of operations in any period presented.\nThird Party\nThird party includes revenue related to MCOs. The majority of Dx's third-party revenue is reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. These payers are billed at Dx's established list price and revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. The majority of Dx’s MCO revenues are recorded based upon contractually negotiated fee schedules with revenues for non-contracted MCOs recorded based on historical reimbursement experience.\nThird-party reimbursement is also received through capitation agreements with MCOs and independent physician associations (IPAs). Under capitated agreements, revenue is recognized based on a negotiated per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by Dx from a capitation pool. When the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing performed. Under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. Dx recognizes revenue monthly, based upon the established capitation rate or anticipated distribution from a capitated pool.\nDx has a formal process to estimate implicit price concessions for uncollectable accounts. The majority of Dx's collection risk is related to accounts receivable from both insured and uninsured patients who are unwilling or unable to pay. Anticipated write-offs are recorded as adjustments to revenue at an amount considered necessary to record the segment's revenue at its net realizable value. In addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials and other external factors that could affect the collectability of its receivables are considered when determining revenue and the net receivable amount. Any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. These adjustments are not material to Dx's results of operations in any period presented.\nBLS\nBLS revenue is generally recognized over time, as the services are delivered to the customer, based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. The majority of BLS's contracts contain a single performance obligation, as BLS provides a significant service of integrating all promises in the contract and the promises are highly interdependent and interrelated with one another. For contracts that include multiple performance obligations, BLS allocates the contract value to the goods and services based on a customer price list, if available. If a price list is not available, BLS will estimate the transaction price using either market prices or an “expected cost plus margin” approach. The total contract value is estimated at the beginning of the contract, and is equal to the amount expected to be billed to the customer. These contracts generally take the form of fixed-price or fee-for-service arrangements subject to pricing adjustments based on changes in scope.\nFixed-price contracts are typically recognized as revenue over time based on a proportional-performance basis, using either input or output methods that are specific to the service provided. In an output method, revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of output achieved by the total units of output required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. When using an input method, revenue is recognized by dividing the actual costs incurred by the total estimated cost expected to complete the contract, and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. Contract costs principally include direct labor costs, research model costs and allocated overhead costs. The estimate of total costs expected to complete the contract requires significant judgment and these estimates are reviewed periodically. Any adjustments to these estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known.\nFee-for-service contracts are typically priced based on transaction volume or time and materials. For volume-based contracts the contract value is entirely variable and revenue is recognized as the specific product or service is completed. For services billed based on time and materials, revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient.\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. Generally, when contract modifications create new performance obligations, the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively. When contract modifications change existing performance obligations, the impact on the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nMost contracts are terminable with or without cause by the customer, either immediately or upon notice. These contracts often require payment to BLS of expenses incurred and fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to BLS of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by BLS under the contract if it had not been terminated early. Termination fees are included in revenues when services have been performed and realization is assured.\nBLS incurs sales commissions in the process of obtaining contracts with customers, which are recoverable through the service fees in the contract. Sales commissions that are payable upon contract award are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected contract term, along with related payroll tax expense. The amortization of commission expense is based on the weighted average contract duration for all commissionable awards in the respective business in which the commission expense is paid, which approximates the period over which goods and services are transferred to the customer. The amortization period of sales commissions ranges from approximately 1 to 5 years, depending on the business. For businesses that enter primarily short-term contracts, BLS applies the practical expedient which allows costs to obtain a contract to be expensed when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less. Amortization of assets from sales commissions is included in selling, general, and administrative expense.\nBLS incurs costs to fulfill contracts with customers, which are recoverable through the service fees in the contract. Contract fulfillment costs include software implementation costs and setup costs for certain services. These costs are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected term of the contract to which the implementation relates, which is the period over which services are expected to be provided to the customer. This period typically ranges from 2 to 5 years. Amortization of deferred contract fulfillment costs is included in cost of goods sold."", 'Capital expenditures for the acquisition of long-lived assets by reportable segment were:\nYears ended June 30,\n($ in millions)\t\t2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\nFlexibles\t\t$\t372 \t\t\t$\t384 \t\t\t$\t376 \t\nRigid Packaging\t\t112 \t\t\t133 \t\t\t136 \t\nOther\t\t8 \t\t\t9 \t\t\t15 \t\nTotal capital expenditures for the acquisition of long-lived assets\t\t$\t492 \t\t\t$\t526 \t\t\t$\t527', 'The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management.\nHomebuilding Inventory\nThe carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units. Field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs. Interest costs are not capitalized into inventory, with the exception of land under development and joint venture investments, as applicable. Upon settlement, the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis. Cost of building materials is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nSold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual sales price compared to the total estimated cost to construct. Unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete. Any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales.\nContract Land Deposits\nWe purchase finished lots under LPAs that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract. The deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots.\nWe maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period. To analyze contract land deposit impairments, we conduct a loss contingency analysis each quarter. In addition to considering market and economic conditions, we assess contract land deposit impairments on a community-by-community basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms, analyzing quantitative and qualitative information including, as applicable, current sales absorption levels, recent sales’ profit margin, the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots, a developer’s performance, a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices, if necessary, and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default.\nOur analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market. Because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit, if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price, we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract, forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract, or whether we will attempt to restructure the LPA, which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer. We also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s non-performance because of financial or other conditions.\nAlthough we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate (see Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein), there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry.\nWarranty/Product Liability Reserves\nWe establish warranty and product liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to our homebuilding business. Liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with our General Counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases. Although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate (see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein), there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor, the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action, unanticipated adverse legal settlements, or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe recognize equity-based compensation expense within our income statement for all share-based payment arrangements, which include Options and RSUs. Compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the Options and RSUs granted, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award (from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant). Options and RSUs which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “service-only” Options and RSUs, and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved. We calculate the fair value of our Options, which are not publicly traded, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the RSUs is the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant. The reversal of compensation expense previously recognized for grants forfeited is recorded in the period in which the forfeiture occurs.\nAs noted above, we calculate the fair value of our Options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. While the Black-Scholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options, its results are dependent on input variables, two of which, expected term and expected volatility, are significantly dependent on management’s judgment. We have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an Option’s expected term. To estimate expected volatility, we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the Option’s expected term. Changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grant-date fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement.\nIn addition, when recognizing equity-based compensation cost related to “performance condition” Option and RSU grants, we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period. The performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of Option grant. While we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such Options and RSUs accordingly, our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination, resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition Option and RSU grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date.  \nAlthough we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2023 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grant-date fair value of unvested Options and RSUs outstanding, changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest, could produce widely different expense valuations and recognition.\nMortgage Repurchase Reserve\nWe originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home. We sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market, typically on a servicing released basis and within 30 days from closing. All of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor. Those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, VA and FHA. Insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards, we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans, except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment defaults occur. We employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating, and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. We maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold. The reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure. Although we consider the mortgage repurchase reserve reflected on the December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate (see Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein), there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage repurchase reserve.', 'Long-duration contracts\nPolicy acquisition costs are grouped by contract type and issue year into cohorts consistent with the groupings used in estimating the associated liability and are expensed on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts to approximate straight-line amortization at the contract level. The constant level basis used for amortization is the insurance in-force and is projected using the same assumptions used in estimating the liability for future policy benefits. If those projected assumptions change in future periods, they will be reflected in the cohort level amortization basis at that time. Unexpected changes in the in-force portfolio, due to variances in mortality and lapse experience, are recognized over the contract term. Changes in future mortality and lapse assumptions are also recognized prospectively over the remaining expected contract term.\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred except for direct-response campaigns that qualify for cost deferral. Qualified expenses include individual direct-response marketing campaigns where we can demonstrate the campaigns have specifically resulted in incremental sales to customers and such sales have probable future economic benefits. Any costs directly related to the marketing campaigns are deferred, included with other policy acquisition costs, and expensed as a component of Policy acquisition costs using the same amortization basis.', 'The components of Acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\t$\t(2,021)\t\t\t$\t(1,912)\t\t\t$\t(2,404)\t\nAmortization of property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment\t(60)\t\t\t(89)\t\t\t(111)\t\nAmortization of customer contractual obligations related to acquired loss-making and below-market contracts\t83 \t\t\t108 \t\t\t312 \t\nAcquisition accounting adjustments\t$\t(1,998)\t\t\t$\t(1,893)\t\t\t$\t(2,203)\t\n \nAcquisition accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in each segment were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nCollins Aerospace\t$\t(854)\t\t\t$\t(865)\t\t\t$\t(782)\t\nPratt & Whitney\t(287)\t\t\t(243)\t\t\t(160)\t\nRaytheon\t(857)\t\t\t(785)\t\t\t(1,260)\t\nTotal segment\t(1,998)\t\t\t(1,893)\t\t\t(2,202)\t\nEliminations and other\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t(1)\t\nAcquisition accounting adjustments\t$\t(1,998)\t\t\t$\t(1,893)\t\t\t$\t(2,203)\t\n \nAcquisition accounting adjustments in 2023 were relatively consistent with 2022.\nThe change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, is primarily driven by a decrease in Raytheon intangibles amortization related to the Raytheon merger, partially offset by $116 million of amortization of customer contractual obligations due to the accelerated liquidation of below-market contract reserves at Collins in 2021 driven by the termination of two customer contracts.', 'The Company accounts for real estate acquisitions as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Under either model, the Company identifies and determines the fair value of any assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The Company generally views acquisitions of individual operating communities as asset acquisitions, which results in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities.']",1162.2484169201923,0

definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X and Financial Accounting Standards Board. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Occidental’s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and government restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments.\nThe most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental’s oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD&A rate. For example, a 5% increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD&A rate by approximately $0.65/Bbl, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $290 million annually at current production rates.', 'DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n \n\n \n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nASSETS\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCurrent assets:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n \n\n$\n\n875\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n1,454\n\n \n\nAccounts receivable\n\n \n\n \n\n1,573\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,767\n\n \n\nInventory\n\n \n\n \n\n249\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n201\n\n \n\nOther current assets\n\n \n\n \n\n460\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n469\n\n \n\nTotal current assets\n\n \n\n \n\n3,157\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3,891\n\n \n\nOil and gas property and equipment, based on successful efforts accounting, net\n\n \n\n \n\n17,825\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n16,567\n\n \n\nOther property and equipment, net ($136 million and $109 million related to CDM in \n   2023 and 2022, respectively)\n\n \n\n \n\n1,503\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,539\n\n \n\nTotal property and equipment, net\n\n \n\n \n\n19,328\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n18,106\n\n \n\nGoodwill\n\n \n\n \n\n753\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n753\n\n \n\nRight-of-use assets\n\n \n\n \n\n267\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n224\n\n \n\nInvestments\n\n \n\n \n\n666\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n440\n\n \n\nOther long-term assets\n\n \n\n \n\n319\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n307\n\n \n\nTotal assets\n\n \n\n$\n\n24,490\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n23,721\n\n \n\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAccounts payable\n\n \n\n$\n\n760\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n859\n\n \n\nRevenues and royalties payable\n\n \n\n \n\n1,222\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,506\n\n \n\nShort-term debt\n\n \n\n \n\n483\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n251\n\n \n\nOther current liabilities\n\n \n\n \n\n484\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n489\n\n \n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n \n\n \n\n2,949\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3,105\n\n \n\nLong-term debt\n\n \n\n \n\n5,672\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6,189\n\n \n\nLease liabilities\n\n \n\n \n\n295\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n257', 'DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE EARNINGS\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2023\n\n \n\n \n\n2022\n\n \n\n \n\n2021\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(Millions, except per share amounts)\n\n \n\nOil, gas and NGL sales\n\n \n\n$\n\n10,791\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n14,082\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n9,531\n\n \n\nOil, gas and NGL derivatives\n\n \n\n \n\n118\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(658\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n(1,544\n\n)\n\nMarketing and midstream revenues\n\n \n\n \n\n4,349\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5,745\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4,219\n\n \n\nTotal revenues\n\n \n\n \n\n15,258\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19,169\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12,206\n\n \n\nProduction expenses\n\n \n\n \n\n2,928\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2,797\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2,131\n\n \n\nExploration expenses\n\n \n\n \n\n20\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n29\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n14\n\n \n\nMarketing and midstream expenses\n\n \n\n \n\n4,409\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5,780\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4,238\n\n \n\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n\n \n\n \n\n2,554\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2,223\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2,158\n\n \n\nAsset dispositions\n\n \n\n \n\n(30\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n(44\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n(168\n\n)\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\n \n\n \n\n408\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n395\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n391\n\n \n\nFinancing costs, net\n\n \n\n \n\n308\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n309\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n329\n\n \n\nRestructuring and transaction costs\n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n258\n\n \n\nOther, net\n\n \n\n \n\n38\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(95\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n(43\n\n)\n\nTotal expenses\n\n \n\n \n\n10,635\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11,394\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9,308\n\n \n\nEarnings before income taxes\n\n \n\n \n\n4,623\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7,775\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2,898\n\n \n\nIncome tax expense\n\n \n\n \n\n841\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,738\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n65\n\n \n\nNet earnings\n\n \n\n \n\n3,782\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6,037\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2,833\n\n \n\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n \n\n \n\n35\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n22', 'As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries are engaged in exploration and production (Upstream) activities across three operating segments: Egypt, North Sea, and the U.S. The Company’s Upstream business explores for, develops, and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

Company acquired 100% of the equity interest of Bionic Stork, Ltd. (“Bionic”), a privately-held company that provides an Application Security Posture Management platform designed to proactively reduce and mitigate security, data privacy, and operational risks by analyzing application architecture and dependencies that run in production.\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The total consideration transferred consisted of $239.0 million in cash, net of $25.7 million of cash acquired, and $0.7 million representing the fair value of replacement equity awards attributable to pre-acquisition service. The remaining fair value of these replacement awards attributed to post-combination service was excluded from the purchase price. The purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis, subject to working capital adjustment and continuing management analysis, to identified intangible assets, which include developed technology and customer relationships of $34.9 million, net tangible liabilities acquired of $2.7 million, and goodwill of $207.5 million, which was allocated to the Company’s one reporting unit and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The goodwill was primarily attributable to the assembled workforce of Bionic, planned growth in new markets, and synergies expected to be achieved from the integration of Bionic. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.Per the terms of the share purchase agreement with Bionic, certain unvested stock options held by Bionic employees were canceled and exchanged for replacement stock options under the 2019 Plan. Additionally, certain shares of Bionic stock held by Bionic employees were exchanged for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, subject to service-based vesting and other conditions. Further, the Company granted RSUs and PSUs under the 2019 Plan to certain continuing employees. The awards that are subject to continued service are recognized ratably as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The awards that are subject to both continued service and specified performance targets are recognized over the requisite service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied.\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (dollars in thousands):\nFair Value\t\tUseful Life\n(in months)\nDeveloped technology\t$\t29,900 \t\t\t72\nCustomer relationships\t5,000 \t\t\t96\nTotal intangible assets acquired\t$\t34,900 \t\t\t\n \nAcquisition costs during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 were $4.1 million and are recorded in general and administrative and research and development expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nThe results of operations for the acquisition have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquisition of Bionic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and therefore historical and pro forma disclosures have not been presented.\nReposify Ltd.\nOn October 3, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interest of Reposify Ltd. (“Reposify”), a privately-held company that provides an external attack surface management platform that scans the internet for exposed assets of an organization to detect and eliminate risk from vulnerable and unknown assets before attackers can exploit them. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The total consideration transferred consisted of $18.9 million, net of cash acquired of $0.5 million, and an immaterial amount representing the fair value of replacement equity awards attributable to pre-acquisition service. The remaining fair value of these replacement awards is subject to the recipient’s continued service and thus was excluded from the purchase price. The purchase price was allocated to developed technology of $3.8 million, net tangible assets acquired of $0.9 million, and goodwill of $14.2 million, which was allocated to the Company’s one reporting unit and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The goodwill was primarily attributable to the assembled workforce of Reposify, planned growth in new markets, and synergies expected to be achieved from the integration of Reposify. Goodwill was not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe fair value of the developed technology acquired was $3.8 million with a useful life of 72 months.\nAcquisition costs during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 were not material and are recorded in research and development expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nThe results of operations for the above acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.\nPension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions\nThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 5.06% at the end of fiscal 2024 from 5.94% at the end of fiscal 2023 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2024 year-end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2025 by approximately $0.2 billion and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 28, 2024 by approximately $2.4 billion. A one\n percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $0.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.25%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2025 annual expense by approximately $168 million.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.\nGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, determining whether reporting units should be aggregated, the assignment of assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.\nIn fiscal 2024, we determined that our entertainment businesses, including DTC services, linear networks, and content sales/licensing, should be aggregated into a single reporting unit due to their interdependencies, including shared operating costs such as content, marketing, and technology, the similarity of products and services delivered, customers served and distribution channels used, and projected long term financial performance (e.g., operating margins).\nFor our annual impairment test, we bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.\nTo determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Discount rates are determined based on the inherent risks of the underlying operations.\nSignificant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model used to determine fair value relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our businesses. Changes to these assumptions and shifts in market trends or macroeconomic events could impact test results in the future.\nAs discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, related to our entertainment linear networks reporting unit prior to aggregating all of our entertainment reporting units into a single reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The carrying amount of the aggregated entertainment reporting unit goodwill after these impairments is approximately $51 billion.\nAfter the impairments, the fair value of the entertainment reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount by less than 10%. An approximate 40 basis point increase in the discount rate or an approximate 6% reduction in projected annual cash flows used to determine the fair value of the entertainment reporting unit would effectively eliminate the excess fair value over carrying amount.\nTo test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded $1.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to the Star India Transaction in fiscal 2024 to reflect Star India at its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nThe Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded.\nThe Company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.7 billion and $2.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fiscal 2024 charges related to impairments of retail assets, content assets, and equity investments. The fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.', 'Goodwill\n\nThe following table provides a summary of goodwill activity for the period:\nFlash\t\tHDD\t\tTotal\n(in millions)\nBalance at June 30, 2023\t$\t5,716 \t\t\t$\t4,321 \t\t\t$\t10,037 \t\nForeign currency translation adjustment\t(3)\t\t\t(2)\t\t\t(5)\t\nBalance at June 28, 2024\t$\t5,713 \t\t\t$\t4,319 \t\t\t$\t10,032 \t\n \n\nManagement performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment for both reporting units as of the first day of its fourth quarter ended June 28, 2024 and concluded that there were no impairment indicators as of June 28, 2024.

Revenue is allocated between saleable product, gift with purchase product and purchase with purchase product based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices. Revenue is deferred and ultimately recognized based on the timing differences, if any, between when control of promotional goods and control of the related saleable products transfer to the Company’s customer (e.g., a third-party retailer), which is calculated based on the weighted-average number of days between promotional periods. The estimated standalone selling price allocated to promotional goods is based on a cost plus margin approach. The Company offers a number of different loyalty programs to its customers across regions, brands and distribution channels including points-based programs, tier-based programs and other programs. Revenue is allocated between the saleable product revenue and the material right loyalty obligations based on relative standalone selling prices when the consumer purchases the products that are earning them the right to the future benefits. Deferred revenue related to the Company’s loyalty programs is estimated based on the standalone selling price and is adjusted for an estimated breakage factor. Standalone selling price is determined primarily using the observable market price of the good or service benefit if it is sold by the Company or a cost plus margin approach for goods/services not directly sold by the Company. Breakage rates consider historical patterns of redemption and/or expiration. Revenue is recognized when the benefits are redeemed or expire.', 'During the 2022 period, we completed the sale of a 60% interest of Gentiva Hospice to CD&R for cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion, net of cash disposed, including debt repayments from Gentiva Hospice to Humana of $1.9 billion.

Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the inventory reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. An increase or decrease in the lower of cost or net realizable value reserve of 10% would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2023. An increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10% would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2023.', 'Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales:    The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses and is adjusted to reflect results of actual physical inventory counts. We generally perform counts at each location annually, with counts taking place throughout the year. A 10% increase in our year-end inventory shrink reserve would increase cost of sales by approximately $150 million. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reasonably accurate. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months.

Despite significant pressure from headwinds from book-of-business settlement revenue in the comparable period, Corporate Risk & Broking generated solid organic revenue growth driven by strong new business and improved client retention. Insurance Consulting and Technology had organic revenue growth from software sales and increased project revenue.', 'Gross Profit. Gross profit increased due to higher pricing and sales volumes, which supported a 30 basis point increase in the gross profit margin. The impact from foreign currency movements decreased the gross profit margin by approximately 60 basis points, primarily from the impact of lower hedge gains in the current year compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, the increase in the gross profit margin was supported by recurring revenue net price gains, which mitigated the inflationary cost impacts that contributed to higher product and labor costs. Sales mix, including effects from high CAG Diagnostic consumable growth; software services gross margin expansion; and productivity gains in our reference laboratories also contributed to the increase in our gross profit margin.']",984.3855830840766,I don’t know

We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are incurred in the U.S. and are included in our North America and AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews consolidated net sales, consolidated operating expenses, and consolidated operating income (loss) by segment. Amounts included in consolidated operating expenses include “Cost of sales,” “Fulfillment,” “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” “General and administrative,” and “Other operating expense (income), net.” Our CODM manages our business by reviewing annual forecasts and consolidated results by segment on a quarterly basis.\nNorth America\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and subscription services through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.\nInternational\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and subscription services through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.\nAWS\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.\nInformation on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions):\n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \t2021\t\t2022\t\t2023\nNorth America\t\t\t\t\t\nNet sales\t$\t279,833 \t\t\t$\t315,880 \t\t\t$\t352,828 \t\nOperating expenses\t272,562 \t\t\t318,727 \t\t\t337,951 \t\nOperating income (loss)\t$\t7,271 \t\t\t$\t(2,847)\t\t\t$\t14,877 \t\nInternational\t\t\t\t\t\nNet sales\t$\t127,787 \t\t\t$\t118,007 \t\t\t$\t131,200 \t\nOperating expenses\t128,711 \t\t\t125,753 \t\t\t133,856 \t\nOperating loss\t$\t(924)\t\t\t$\t(7,746)\t\t\t$\t(2,656)\t\nAWS\t\t\t\t\t\nNet sales\t$\t62,202 \t\t\t$\t80,096 \t\t\t$\t90,757 \t\nOperating expenses\t43,670 \t\t\t57,255 \t\t\t66,126 \t\nOperating income\t$\t18,532 \t\t\t$\t22,841 \t\t\t$\t24,631 \t\nConsolidated\t\t\t\t\t\nNet sales\t$\t469,822 \t\t\t$\t513,983 \t\t\t$\t574,785 \t\nOperating expenses\t444,943 \t\t\t501,735 \t\t\t537,933 \t\nOperating income\t24,879 \t\t\t12,248 \t\t\t36,852 \t\nTotal non-operating income (expense)\t13,272 \t\t\t(18,184)\t\t\t705 \t\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\t(4,791)\t\t\t3,217 \t\t\t(7,120)\t\nEquity-method investment activity, net of tax\t4 \t\t\t(3)\t\t\t(12)\t\nNet income (loss)\t$\t33,364 \t\t\t$\t(2,722)\t\t\t$\t30,425', 'Geographic Area Information. Northern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source income and assets. Non-U.S. source income and assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nFor purposes of this disclosure, all foreign exchange trading income has been allocated to non-U.S. operations. Interest expense is allocated to non-U.S. operations based on specifically matched or pooled funding.

In some instances, partial or full insurance coverage is available for the Company's liabilities. The costs to resolve cases during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were not material individually or in the aggregate. The Company’s estimate of asbestos-related liabilities is subject to uncertainty because liabilities are influenced by many variables that are inherently difficult to predict. Although the Company believes the ultimate resolution of current cases will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, it cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can, therefore, give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related litigation."", 'Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped. Because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement, and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period, we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue. \n\n \n\nTypical supply chain lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks. We often build inventory in advance based on our forecast of future customer orders. This subjects us to certain risks, most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast, which could lead to inventories in excess of demand. If excess inventory exists, it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount, take a significant write-down or dispose of it altogether, all of which would negatively affect our profit margins. In addition, in response to market conditions, we may slow the rate of manufacturing our products, which could result in insufficient inventory levels and reduced sales if we underestimate the demand for our products.', 'Other Litigation - The Company and its predecessor-in-interest have been in litigation with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the ""Republic"") since 2002 over a contract for the repair, refurbishment, and modernization at Ingalls of two foreign-built frigates. Following an arbitration proceeding between the parties, in February 2018 the arbitral tribunal awarded the Company approximately $151 million on its claims and awarded the Republic approximately $22 million on its counterclaims. In November 2023, the Company sold its judgment against the Republic to a third party in exchange for an initial cash payment of $70.5 million, recognized in the Ingalls segment\'s other income and gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The Company\'s consideration also includes a contingent participating interest in the final amount recovered.', 'In July 2023 the DOE submitted an offer of judgment to resolve claims in the Indian Point 2 fourth round and Indian Point 3 third round combined damages case. The $59 million offer was accepted by Entergy and Holtec International, as the current owner. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a final judgment in that amount in favor of Holtec Indian Point 2, LLC and Holtec Indian Point 3, LLC (previously Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 2, LLC and Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 3, LLC) and against the DOE. Holtec received payment from the U.S. Treasury in July 2023. Consistent with certain terms agreed upon in connection with the sale of Indian Point Energy Center in May 2021, Holtec transferred $40 million to Entergy for its pro-rata share of the litigation proceeds in August 2023. The remainder of the judgment was retained by Holtec. The effect of recording Entergy’s pro-rata share of the judgment was a reduction to asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges (credits). Entergy’s pro-rata share of the damages awarded included $18 million related to costs previously recorded as spending on the asset retirement obligation, $15 million related to costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expenses, $6 million related to costs previously recorded as plant, and $1 million related to costs previously recorded as taxes other than income taxes.', 'Antitrust Complaint - On October 6, 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against the Company and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

The named plaintiffs generally allege that the defendant companies have adhered to a “gentlemen’s agreement” that prohibits any defendant from actively recruiting naval engineers from other defendants. The complaint seeks class certification, treble damages, and any other relief to which the plaintiffs are entitled. Depending on the outcome of the lawsuit, the Company could be subject to penalties and damages that could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Available Capital for Capital Adequacy best reflects the available capital resources of our operations.\nWe maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $7.5 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the parent company had $544 million and $389 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage back securities. Additional sources of liquidity include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $727 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $1.0 billion that expires in June 2026. Management’s estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of December 31, 2023 was $1.8 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility.\nUnder the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We remain in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, and advances at the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), and Ameriprise Bank are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $8.6 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, of borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities, of which $201 million was outstanding as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. In addition, Ameriprise Bank maintains access to borrowings from the Federal Reserve which are collateralized with residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and\ncorporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we estimated $12.3 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, of borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve in addition to the FHLB capacity and there were no outstanding obligations.\nShort-term contractual obligations for the year 2024 include investment certificate maturities of $12.3 billion and estimated insurance and annuity benefits of $2.2 billion in addition to operating liquidity needs and maturing long-term debt in October 2024 of $550 million. We also hold banking and brokerage deposits of $23.9 billion that are payable on demand. Long-term contractual obligations for years after 2024 include estimated insurance and annuity benefits of $55.2 billion.\nOn March 9, 2023, we issued $750 million of 5.15% unsecured senior notes due May 15, 2033. We repaid $750 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes at maturity on October 16, 2023. On November 9, 2023, we issued $600 million of 5.7% unsecured senior notes due December 15, 2028.

We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) and the share repurchase excise tax. Both the CAMT and share repurchase tax were effective beginning in 2023. We are an applicable corporation required to compute the CAMT; however, based on current estimates we do not expect to be liable for the CAMT in 2023 and therefore a liability has not been recorded. We are a covered corporation subject to the 1% excise tax on the net shares repurchased. We have recorded in shareholders’ equity an estimate of the excise tax liability based on our interpretation of the current guidance. As the Internal Revenue Service issues additional guidance related to the IRA, we will continue to evaluate any impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published the Pillar Two model rules which introduce new taxing mechanisms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) pay a minimum level of tax on profits from each jurisdiction in which they operate. Various jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation that became effective beginning January 1, 2024.

The decline in our LPD business was primarily due to lower herd health screening volume, partially offset by higher realized prices and volume growth in North America, Europe, and South America.

As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 9% of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the four largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 20%, with the remaining 80% owned by regional and local operators. We believe our Public Storage® brand awareness, as well as the innovative improvements we have made to the customer experience described below, provide us with a competitive advantage in acquiring and retaining customers relative to other self-storage operators. The high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility, such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators, who use marketing channels, including Internet advertising, signage, and banners, and offer services similar to ours. As a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income, and operating expenses of our facilities. However, we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business result in our being able to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale.', 'Corporate Structure and Business\nWe are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties under numerous brand names at different price and service points. Consistent with our focus on management, franchising, and licensing, we own or lease very few of our lodging properties (less than one percent of our system).\nThe following table shows our portfolio of brands at year-end 2023.We discuss our operations in the following two operating segments, both of which meet the applicable criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment: (1) U.S. & Canada and (2) International. In January 2024, we modified our segment structure as a result of a change in the way management intends to evaluate results and allocate resources within the Company. Beginning with the 2024 first quarter, we will report the following four operating segments: (1) U.S. & Canada, (2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa, (3) Asia Pacific excluding China, and (4) Greater China. Our Caribbean and Latin America operating segment will not meet the applicable criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment, and as such, we will include its results in “Unallocated corporate and other.” See Note 14 for more information.\nCompany-Operated Properties\nAt year-end 2023, we had 2,096 company-operated properties (589,078 rooms), which included properties under long-term management or lease agreements with property owners (management and lease agreements together, the “Operating Agreements”) and properties that we own.\nTerms of our management agreements vary, but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations (both direct and indirect). Such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years, with options for us to renew for up to 10 or more additional years.

In certain circumstances, some of our management agreements allow owners to convert company-operated properties to franchised properties under our brands.\nFor the lodging properties we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the employees needed to operate the properties and for incurring operational and administrative costs related to the operation of the properties, and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs.

Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to trustees or are paid directly by us from general funds. In 1999, we implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings credit continued to accrue for fifteen years for certain active employees participating in the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments. Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Effective as of January 1, 2011, our U.S. pension plans were amended so that employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the plans. All collective bargaining units adopted this amendment by December 31, 2011.\nIn June 2023, we settled $245 million of our pension benefit obligations associated with approximately 6,000 retired participants that were receiving benefits within our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. A group annuity contract was purchased on behalf of these participants with a third-party insurance provider and funded directly by $241 million from the assets of our pension plans, resulting in an actuarial gain of $4 million.\nPostretirement Benefits — We provide postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance to eligible retired U.S. employees, and where applicable, their dependents. Accordingly, we sponsor a retiree medical program for eligible retired U.S. employees and fund applicable retiree medical accounts intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses on a tax-favored basis for retirees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements. Effective as of January 1, 2019, we no longer sponsor our own retiree medical coverage for substantially all retired U.S. employees that are Medicare eligible. Instead, we offer these Medicare-eligible retirees access to health care coverage through a private exchange and offer a health reimbursement account to subsidize benefits for a select group of such retirees. We also provide postretirement life insurance to all eligible U.S. employees who retired prior to January 1, 2018, as well as certain eligible retired employees covered by one of our collective bargaining agreements who retired prior to January 1, 2023.\nDetermining net periodic benefit expense (income) is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.', 'The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $36 million.\n\nBased on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.\n\nPension benefits are further described in Note 24 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLegal and other contingencies:    We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Note 15 to the Financial Statements for further information on contingencies.', 'Payments of retirement plan obligations include employer commitments to fund our defined benefit and postretirement plans and do not include estimated future benefit payments to participants expected to be made from liquidation of the assets in our defined benefit plan trusts. As of December 31, 2023, our defined benefit pension plans had a projected benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of the plans’ assets by $21.5 million and our postretirement benefit plan had a projected benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of the plans’ assets by $8.5 million. We expect to satisfy these remaining obligations through investment income from and appreciation in the fair value of plan assets and from future employer contributions.

Increases in our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging services recurring revenue also contributed to higher revenue supported by demand for subscription-based software.

The decline in our LPD business was primarily due to lower herd health screening volume, partially offset by higher realized prices and volume growth in North America, Europe, and South America.
