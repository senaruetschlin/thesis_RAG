• Always extract relevant numbers and think step-by-step. Show calculations if a numeric answer is requested. 
• For multi-turn conversations, treat prior Q/A pairs as authoritative inputs for subsequent calculations.
• When a numeric answer is required, return it in plain digits (no “$”, “%”, or “units”) unless the question asks for them.  
• When citing tables, reference the exact row/column text.

Question: what was the percent change in net income from 2015 to 2016?
Context: T1 – Net income in 2015 was $20 million. In 2016, it was $34 million.
Answer: 70%

Question: What was the total net revenue in 2022 and 2023?
Context: T1 – 2022: $56,000,000; 2023: $61,000,000
Answer: 117000000

Question:  
Q: What was the net income in 2020?  
A: 450  
Q: And in 2021?  
A: 620  
Q: What is the percent increase?  
Context: [No additional context needed]  
**Step 0**: Prior answers provide the required numbers (450 and 620).  
**Step 1**: Clarify if "percent increase" uses 2020 as baseline. (Confirmed: yes).  
**Step 2**:  
+ 2020 = 450; 2021 = 620  
+ Delta = 620 - 450 = 170  
+ % increase = (170 / 450) × 100 = 37.777...  
**Step 3**: Cross-check: (620/450) - 1 = 0.377... → Correct.  
Answer: 37.78%

Below are passages and tables returned by the retrieval module.  
Text chunks are numbered T1, T2… ; tables are numbered B1, B2… .
Read all chunks carefully. Even partially relevant ones may contain useful clues.

# = = =  NEW QUESTION  = = =
{QUESTION}

**Step 0 – System-2 Attention (noise pruning)**  
Identify which parts of the context may contain relevant numbers or facts, and briefly explain why. List the T#/ B# that contain numeric data relevant to the question.
If the question is part of a conversation, check prior Q/A pairs for numeric inputs additionally to the context. 

**Step 1 – Take-a-Step-Back / abstraction**  
Write 1-2 high-level clarifying sub-questions about regulations, financial concepts, or definitions that are required to solve the problem.  
Answer them from the context above.

**Step 2 – Chain-of-Thought / Chain-of-Table reasoning**  
• For text: reason line-by-line, citing T#.  
• For tables: specify the row/column, and perform explicit calculations (SQL-style or df-style), e.g.  
  `SELECT "Net income 2023" - "Net income 2022" AS delta`  
Keep every arithmetic operation visible.
For numbers: extract raw values first, then show each step of your calculation. Example:
+   Net income 2022 = 20; Net income 2023 = 34
+   % change = ((34 - 20) / 20) × 100 = 70
If the answer is descriptive, synthesize and condense key ideas into 1–2 sentences. Focus on concrete drivers, actions, or consequences from the context.

**Step 3 – Self-check**  
Reread your reasoning.  If you spot an error, correct it **before** producing the final answer.

**Step 4 – FINAL ANSWER** (one line if numeric; 1-2 sentences if descriptive; no extra text)
- If descriptive, return 1–2 clear sentences summarizing key facts. 
- If the answer is numeric, first check whether the question specifies a unit (e.g., %, USD, shares). If it does, include that exact unit in your final answer. If no unit is mentioned, return the number as plain digits without any symbols.
Return only the answer here.
